# Scholario-OS Worklog

## Project Snapshot

- **App**: Scholario — multi-role school ERP (Super Admin / Principal / Teacher / Student).
- **Source**: imported from github.com/akasharyan4748-droid/Scholario-oz @ ff026a7.
- **Entry**: single route `/` (src/app/page.tsx) — client-side SPA; role panels:
  `src/components/{principal,teacher,student,superadmin}/*-panel*`.
- **Auth**: credential login (localStorage `scholario-auth` + httpOnly session cookie), API `/api/auth/login`.
  - principal@greenwood.edu.in / principal123
  - rohan.mehta@greenwood.edu.in / teacher123
  - aarav.sharma@greenwood.edu.in / student123
  - admin@scholario.cloud / admin123
- **Data layer**: Prisma + SQLite (`db/custom.db`, `DATABASE_URL=file:/home/z/my-project/db/custom.db`)
  plus Zustand persisted stores (tenant-scoped) under `src/lib/store/*`.
- **Tenants**: School A (Demo/Greenwood) + School B (SPS-002) — capability matrix in `src/lib/tenant/*`.
- **Realtime**: socket.io event-stream mini-service on :3003 (broadcasts payments/announcements/messages
  polled from SQLite); frontend connects via `io("/?XTransformPort=3003")`; gateway forwarding verified
  (`curl ":81/?XTransformPort=3003&EIO=4&transport=polling"` → sid 200).
- **Env**: Next.js 16 (Turbopack) on :3000 via `bun run dev`; keepalive watchdog `keepalive.mjs`
  auto-restarts the dev server if it dies.

Task ID: 1
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: Import github.com/akasharyan4748-droid/Scholario-oz into the sandbox, production-ready: no garbage, no dead deps, all four roles working.

Work Log:
- Cloned repo @ ff026a7 (1639 files). Excluded garbage from import: qa-*.png, qa-shots/, screenshots/,
  verify/, agent-tasks/, agent-ctx/, audit-report.txt, old worklogs, scripts/, upload/ pasted-content txts,
  mini-services/dev-server (a supervisor that would double-start `bun run dev` because sandbox
  `.zscripts/dev.sh` auto-starts every mini-service with a dev script → EADDRINUSE loop), prisma/dev.db
  (stale copy; canonical DB is db/custom.db).
- Imported: src/ (1236 files, 161 API routes), prisma/ (schema + seed scripts), db/custom.db (seeded 1.5MB),
  public/ (logo.svg, robots.txt), mini-services/event-stream (socket.io :3003), .env, next.config.ts,
  tsconfig.json, eslint.config.mjs (repo rules + cleaned ignores), .gitignore.
- package.json: renamed scholario-os@1.0.0; removed 14 unused deps after full `rg` audit
  (@dnd-kit/*, @google/genai, @hookform/resolvers, @mdxeditor/editor, @reactuses/core, @supabase/supabase-js,
  @tanstack/react-query, @tanstack/react-table, next-auth, next-intl, react-markdown,
  react-syntax-highlighter, uuid, zod) — kept everything actually imported.
- Converted `/api/ai/generate-questions` from @google/genai (needed GEMINI_API_KEY, never set) to
  z-ai-web-dev-sdk (sandbox standard, actually works); template fallback preserved.
- Verified repo's rumored `page.tsx` line-41 corruption is a terminal display artifact — `od -c` shows
  `const [mounted, setMounted]` intact; no ESC bytes anywhere in src/. No fix needed.
- bun install ✓ · prisma generate ✓ · db push "already in sync" ✓ · tsc --noEmit 0 errors ✓ · lint clean ✓.
- event-stream service cleaned: removed dead HTTP health-probe handler (engine.io owns every path when
  path:'/'); documented handshake-as-health-check (`curl ":3003/?EIO=4&transport=polling"` → 200).
- All four role logins verified 200 via API; gateway socket.io forwarding verified.

Stage Summary:
- Codebase imported clean: zero tsc errors, zero lint errors, zero unused deps, DB seeded and in sync.

Task ID: 2
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: Stabilize the app against sandbox OOM kills (4GB cgroup, no swap) and make all four roles browsable.

Work Log:
- Diagnosed the crash pattern: Turbopack dev root compile ~2.8-2.9GB RSS retained; +headless browser
  (~700MB) + any new compile/packaging spike → cgroup OOM kills next-server mid-session
  (ChunkLoadError / blank page in the browser). The repo's own worklog documents the same 4GB fight.
- Code-split all four role panels at MODULE granularity via next/dynamic + shared `ModuleLoading` skeleton
  (`src/components/shared/module-loading.tsx`): principal-panel registry (19 modules), teacher
  module-router (13) + MySalaryModule, student-panel (14), superadmin-panel (3). Lazy chunks = browser
  loads only the active module; nav shows a skeleton while a chunk compiles. tsc + lint stay clean.
- Memory tuning (empirically A/B tested):
  - `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1024` in the dev script.
  - `turbopackMemoryLimit: 2200` — 1400 makes big compiles crash-loop (eviction thrash mid-compile;
    reproduced twice); 2200 lets the ~25s root compile finish. Any config change invalidates the
    Turbopack cache → full recompile — do NOT flip configs casually.
- Built `keepalive.mjs` (project root; log/pid at root, NOT .zscripts — a sandbox process periodically
  resets .zscripts and deleted files there): probes `robots.txt` every 10s (**never `/`** — a page probe
  triggers a ~3GB compile and a probing watchdog keeps a fresh server in a permanent compile→OOM crash
  loop — reproduced), respawns `bun run dev` if dead, waits for health, exponential backoff 30→300s.
- Cache warm-up (server-side, zero browser): `/home/z/.qa/warm-chunks.sh` recursively fetches the page +
  every chunk referenced in runtime chunk tables (319 chunks, fixpoint); `/home/z/.qa/warm-apis.sh`
  pace-warms all 160 API routes (8s spacing for GC headroom, health-checked, auto-resumes after restarts).
  Ran twice (re-run after config flips invalidated cache). All 160 routes warmed with zero deaths when paced.
- Discovered the VersionGuard reload loop: with a browser open, a server death → respawn → VersionGuard
  auto-reloads the page → the heavy reload itself OOMs the marginal server → loop. Mitigation: browser QA
  in short bursts, browser CLOSED between batches (the steady-state serving server is stable indefinitely).

Stage Summary:
- Module code splitting + tuned memory limits + static-asset keepalive probe + full chunk/API warm-up +
  browser-burst discipline = all four roles browsable; self-healing in ~5-60s if OOM still strikes.

Task ID: 3
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: End-to-end browser verification of all four roles + final polish.

Work Log:
- **Public website**: full render (hero, why-us, stages, facilities, admissions inquiry form, footer),
  zero console errors. Login Portal ↔ public navigation works; hash routes (#portal/#platform) work.
- **Principal** (Dr. Ananya Iyer): Dashboard KPIs live (1,842 students · 96 teachers · 93% attendance ·
  ₹1.84 Cr pending fees · 47 admissions · Principal Attention alerts). Modules verified rendering with real
  data: Examinations, Fee Management (₹5.19 L collected, trend charts, outstanding dues), Library
  (catalogue, overdue/fines), Certificates, Settings. Sign-out works.
- **Teacher** (Rohan Mehta): Dashboard with position-assignment banner (Examination Incharge, real
  workflow). Modules verified: My Timetable, Marks Entry, Lesson Planner, Class Attendance.
- **Student** (Aarav Sharma): Dashboard (Grade 9-A · Roll 18 · 100% attendance · Up Next). Modules
  verified: Timetable, Results, Learning.
- **Super Admin** (Arjun Malhotra): Platform Overview (3 schools · 2 active · 1 trial · 49 enabled
  modules), Schools (3 demo tenants + Control Center), Platform Controls (adapters, policies).
- **Responsive**: 390px viewport → scrollWidth 390, zero horizontal overflow. Screenshots:
  /home/z/.qa/qa-superadmin-{mobile,desktop}.png.
- Console errors: zero in clean sessions (ChunkLoadErrors only during server-restart windows; the
  app self-recovers via reload).
- Final gates: tsc --noEmit 0 errors ✓ · bun run lint clean ✓ · all 4 logins 200 ✓ · server healthy ✓.
- Cleanup: /tmp/scholario-import removed; no garbage imported (no screenshots/, qa-shots/, agent-ctx/,
  agent-tasks/, verify/, audit-report); no dead deps; no duplicate files.

Stage Summary:
- ALL FOUR ROLES verified end-to-end in the browser with real data, zero lint/tsc errors, responsive at
  390px, self-healing infrastructure. Production-ready within sandbox constraints.

## Current project status

- Dev server :3000 stable (keepalive-guarded), event-stream :3003 running, gateway forwarding verified.
- All chunks + all API routes disk-cached → module loads fast; browser sessions work in bursts.
- Keepalive auto-recovers OOM kills in ~5-60s. The user-visible worst case is a brief auto-reload.
- Round 1 (Task ID 4) complete: Principal account-security parity + shared PasswordField across roles.

## Current goals / verification results

- ✅ Import complete and clean (no garbage, no dead deps, no duplication)
- ✅ Zero tsc errors, zero lint errors
- ✅ AI question generator works via z-ai-web-dev-sdk (no API key needed)
- ✅ All four roles verified in browser: login → dashboard → modules → sign-out
- ✅ Public website, Login Portal, Platform landing render with zero console errors
- ✅ Responsive at 390px (no horizontal overflow)
- ✅ Realtime socket.io handshake verified direct + via gateway
- ✅ Keepalive watchdog + warm-up tooling in place for ongoing stability
- ✅ NEW: Principal Settings → My Account (login & security, change password, session info)
- ✅ NEW: shared PasswordField (eye toggle, live counter, a11y) used by all three role settings
- ✅ Round-1 QA: student Fees/Notices/Messages verified, zero errors

## Unresolved issues / risks / next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (structural)**: 4GB cgroup, no swap; Turbopack dev retains ~2.8GB for this
   app. A headless QA browser (~700MB) + a first-load compile spike can still OOM-kill the server;
   keepalive recovers in ~5-60s and the app auto-reloads. Browser QA should be done in short bursts.
   NEVER probe `/` from any monitor (use robots.txt). NEVER delete .next. NEVER set
   turbopackMemoryLimit below 2200 (compiles crash-loop).
2. **.zscripts resets**: an external sandbox process periodically resets `.zscripts/` (deleted keepalive
   log + 5 infra scripts at ~22:10). Keepalive v3 writes to project root instead. If mini-service logs
   are needed, keep them inside mini-services/<svc>/.
3. **Razorpay webhooks** need RAZORPAY_* env vars for live payments; route degrades gracefully (mock
   provider covers demo flows).
4. Next-phase candidates (for the 15-min webDevReview rounds): deeper per-module data reconciliation
  (fees ↔ applications linkage, certificates history), event-stream end-to-end (payment → school-event
  broadcast → live badge), dark-mode sweep, keyboard nav audit, more module tours per role
  (principal: Admissions/Teachers/Students/Calendar/Transport/Inventory/Downloads/Messaging;
  teacher: Student Directory/Application Reviews/Student Behavior/Performance Analytics/Settings;
  student: Profile/My Class/Attendance/Notices/Messages/Fees/Certificates/Bus/Applications).
5. Warm-up tooling lives in /home/z/.qa/ (warm-chunks.sh, warm-apis.sh, qa-lib.sh login/click helpers) —
  re-run both if the cache is ever invalidated (config change or .next loss); paced API warming takes
  ~25 min, chunk warming ~2 min.

Task ID: 4
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 1 — 2026-09-18/19)
Task: QA sweep + new feature + styling detail (mandatory: features & styling polish).

Work Log:
- QA burst (student role): Fees (balance due, real fee lines), Notices (My Feed/Announcements/Calendar,
  12 items), Messages (real teacher threads, unread counts) — all render, zero console/page errors.
- Gap found: Teacher + Student Settings both have "Login & Security" (change-password UI backed by the
  role-agnostic /api/auth/change-password) — **the Principal had NO account/security surface at all**.
- NEW FEATURE (PR-SEC): `principal/modules/school-settings/security-tab.tsx` — a "My Account" tab at the
  end of the School Settings tab strip: sign-in identity (email, account type, last sign-in from
  User.lastLoginAt), live session context (started, device browser/OS, IP), change-password form (same
  API + revokes other sessions server-side), and sign-out. Wired into index.tsx tab registry
  (value="account", ShieldCheck icon). Verified in browser: tab activates, real data renders
  (principal@greenwood.edu.in · Principal · Chrome·Linux · ::1), validation fires
  ("Fill in all three password fields."), toast flow unchanged.
- STYLING/UX DETAIL: new shared `src/components/shared/password-field.tsx` — show/hide eye toggle
  (aria-label + aria-pressed, keyboard accessible), live "n/6+ chars" counter on new-password fields,
  password-manager autocomplete hints, unified focus ring. Replaced the duplicated PasswordField in
  student AND teacher section-security (killed triplication; removed the now-redundant static
  "Minimum 6 characters" hint). New `SettingsInfoRow` primitive in school-settings/shared.tsx
  (label→value rows with hairlines, matching the Finance InfoRow rhythm).
- MEMORY NOTE (important for next rounds): source edits invalidate chunks → any browser login then
  recompiles them WITH the browser attached → OOM restart loop (reproduced). FIX: after editing files,
  CLOSE the browser, wait for health, run `bash /home/z/.qa/warm-chunks.sh` (~2 min, discovers new chunk
  hashes via the runtime tables), THEN browser QA — this round's verification only succeeded after
  re-warming. Radix tabs need full pointer-event dispatch (pointerdown→mousedown→pointerup→mouseup→click)
  for synthetic activation; plain .click() only works on plain buttons (sidebar nav).
- Gates: tsc --noEmit 0 errors ✓ · bun run lint clean ✓ · console/page errors zero ✓ ·
  screenshot: /home/z/.qa/qa-principal-my-account.png.

Stage Summary:
- Principal now has full account-security parity with Teacher/Student (new tab + real session data).
- One shared PasswordField across all three roles (dedup + eye toggle + live counter + a11y).
- QA: student Fees/Notices/Messages verified; all green.

Task ID: 5
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 2 — 2026-09-19)

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA of all remaining modules, fix bugs, then
feature + styling development (mandates: more features, more styling detail).

Work Log:
- **INFRA INCIDENT (fixed)**: root-page compile hung forever ("○ Compiling / ..." with CPU frozen
  ~0:31, every fresh server, deterministic). Root cause: poisoned Turbopack cache in .next/dev
  after a pre-session crash-loop (keepalive logged restarts 00:20→00:39 before this round began).
  Fix: paused keepalive (SIGSTOP) → killed dev → `mv .next/dev .next/dev.poisoned-*` → keepalive
  resumed → clean compile succeeded in 47s → warm-chunks.sh (319 chunks) → full recovery.
  Quarantine deleted after verification. LESSON: if a fresh server hangs on "Compiling /" for
  >2min with frozen CPU, quarantine .next/dev and let it rebuild (clean compile ≈ 47s).
- **QA — MODULE COVERAGE NOW 100%** across all four roles (browser-verified render + real data):
  - Principal +5: Admissions, Calendar, Transport, Inventory, Downloads.
  - Teacher +7: Student Directory, Application Reviews, Student Behavior, Performance Analytics,
    Exam Duties, My Salary & Payments, My Attendance.
  - Student +6: My Profile, Class Leadership, Attendance, Certificates, Transport, Applications.
  - Super Admin: verified in prior rounds (Overview, Schools, Platform Controls).
- **OOM burst protocol (empirical)**: server retains ~2.8GB RSS after serving pages; kernel OOM
  kills next-server at ~3.0GB anon RSS (dmesg confirmed). Warmed chunks serve from DISK in ~4ms
  (no recompile) — so bursts survive on a FRESH server (~6-7 module loads) but die on a
  loaded one. Protocol: close browser → kill dev tree (bun run dev + next dev + next-server,
  keepalive auto-restarts) → verify robots:200 + low RSS → browser burst ≤6 modules → close.
  Login form gotcha: React controlled inputs need set-value → dispatch → set-value → dispatch
  (setting both before dispatching clears the password on re-render).
- **BUG FIXED (pre-existing)**: public-website Admissions card decorative halo
  (`absolute -top-12 -right-12`) had no overflow-hidden → 23px horizontal scroll at 390px
  (scrollWidth 413). Added `overflow-hidden` to the card wrapper → 391 (remaining 1px is a
  subpixel rounding artifact; zero elements exceed 390).
- **NEW FEATURE — Public Notice Board** (`public-website.tsx`): the /api/schools/public payload
  already carried `announcements` (latest 5, audience ALL/STUDENTS/PUBLIC) but the public site
  never rendered them. New section between Facilities and Admissions: live-pill header
  ("Live notice board", pulsing emerald dot), featured newest notice (calendar-tile date badge,
  priority chip URGENT/HIGH/NORMAL with rose/amber/emerald tones, accent bar, verified-broadcast
  footer line) + compact stack for the rest, portal CTA strip, FadeIn stagger, hover lift,
  dark-mode dual-tone, a11y (article/aria-label/time dateTime). Section hidden entirely when
  no notices. Header nav gained "Notices" → #notices. Renders with 3 real DB announcements.
- **NEW FEATURE — Composer public-reach hint** (`comm-compose.tsx`): when the principal selects
  a public-mapped audience (All Students → STUDENTS), an emerald Globe hint explains the notice
  will also appear on the public website notice board. Verified in browser: hidden for All
  Parents, appears for All Students (58 recipients).
- **Infra**: event-stream :3003 had died mid-round; restarted (direct 200 + gateway forward
  200). Disk cleaned (6.8GB free).
- Gates: `bunx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors ✓ · `bun run lint` clean ✓ · screenshots:
  /home/z/.qa/qa-public-noticeboard{,-2}.png, qa-noticeboard-mobile.png,
  qa-composer-public-hint.png, qa-teacher-behavior.png.
- Console errors: zero in stable windows; only transient "Failed to fetch" during the
  documented OOM-restart windows (self-healing).

Stage Summary:
- 100% module coverage across all 4 roles in the browser; poisoned-cache incident resolved.
- New user-visible capability: principal broadcasts now reach the PUBLIC website (notice board),
  with the connection made explicit inside the composer.
- Pre-existing 390px overflow bug fixed; gates green.

## Current project status (end of round 2)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded), event-stream :3003 healthy (direct + gateway),
  all chunks warmed (319), DB in sync, disk 6.8GB free.
- EVERY module of EVERY role has now been browser-verified at least once across rounds 1–2.
- Zero tsc errors, zero lint errors, no dead code introduced; two focused new features.

## Current goals / verification results (round 2)

- ✅ Poisoned Turbopack cache diagnosed + recovered (clean-cache compile path proven)
- ✅ 100% role/module QA coverage (18 newly verified modules this round)
- ✅ Public Notice Board shipped (real data, responsive, dark-mode, a11y)
- ✅ Composer public-reach hint shipped + browser-verified
- ✅ 390px overflow bug fixed (413 → 391, no overflowing elements)
- ✅ event-stream service restarted + gateway forward verified
- ✅ Gates: tsc 0 errors, lint clean

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (unchanged, structural)**: bursts of ≤6 module loads on a fresh
   server are safe; longer sessions or bursts on a loaded server OOM (self-heals in ~5-60s).
   Next candidate if desired: keepalive "recycle" subcommand to standardize the
   kill→health→warm cycle (manual protocol documented above works).
2. **turbopack cache poisoning can recur** after crash-loops: if "Compiling /" hangs >2min with
   frozen CPU on a fresh server, quarantine .next/dev and rebuild (proven 47s path). Do NOT
   delete .next wholesale — only .next/dev, and never while the server runs.
3. Next-phase feature candidates: dark-mode visual sweep was audited statically (clean — the
   remaining hardcoded colors are intentional paper-document surfaces); deeper candidates:
   timetable ICS export, per-role notification preferences UI, superadmin activity/audit feed,
   public site SEO/OG metadata pass, principal fee-defaulter outreach workflow.
4. The 1px scrollWidth artifact at 390px (391 vs 390) is subpixel rounding — no element
   actually overflows; safe to ignore.

Task ID: 6
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 3 — 2026-09-19)

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA, fix discovered bugs, then
feature + styling development (mandates: more features, more styling detail).

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT**: server healthy, event-stream :3003 healthy, disk 6.8G,
  tsc 0 / lint 0 at round start. Baseline QA burst on the student Timetable
  module found a REAL BUG: "No timetable for Grade 9 - A yet" (empty state).
- **BUG ROOT CAUSE (label-universe mismatch)**: the student Timetable module
  read the Zustand timetable-store seed (className universe "Class 9-A",
  "Class 2-A", "Class 12-Sci-A"…) and joined it on the SERVER enrollment
  label ("Grade 9 - A" from /api/auth/me SD-3b). 0 matches ⇒ empty state.
  The DB Timetable (78 rows, classes "Grade 9 - A"/"Grade 10 - A", 7 teaching
  periods × 6 days each) is the same truth the student Dashboard and the
  Teacher My-Timetable already consume — the module was the odd one out.
- **FIX (server-backed student timetable)**:
  - NEW `GET /api/student/timetable` (requireStudent → classId-scoped rows +
    school-wide master rows + canonical schoolDays; permission model mirrors
    /api/teacher/timetable; nothing fabricated).
  - NEW `student/modules/timetable/server-slots.ts` — maps DB teaching-period
    numbers (1-7, breaks not stored) onto the canonical PERIODS ladder by
    START-TIME matching (fallback: nth non-break ladder period; final
    fallback: synthesized time) so Short Break / Lunch re-appear correctly
    between periods.
  - REWROTE `student/modules/timetable/index.tsx`: server payload is now the
    single source (classLabel, section, mySlots, masterSlots); loading =
    staggered skeleton; error = honest retry card; stale data + failed
    refresh = amber banner with Retry (teacher-module parity); the store is
    used ONLY for the "Updated" publications chip (display-only).
  - Verified in browser: My Class renders Grade 9 - A · Section A, 6 school
    days · 7 subjects, full Saturday timeline with real teacher/room data +
    breaks + live "Next" badge; School view renders the master sheet with
    BOTH real classes and the class filter (All / Grade 9 - A / Grade 10 - A).
- **NEW FEATURE — Timetable ICS calendar export (Student + Teacher)**:
  - NEW `src/lib/ics/builder.ts` — pure RFC 5545 builder: CRLF, 75-octet line
    folding, TEXT escaping, fixed-offset VTIMEZONE (Asia/Kolkata +0530),
    DTSTART/DTEND;TZID, RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;COUNT=12 (one term), stable UIDs,
    X-WR-CALNAME/DESC, and a Blob download helper. Validated offline against
    the real API payload: 42 events, 0 lines >75 octets, correct VTIMEZONE.
  - NEW shared `src/components/shared/export-ics-button.tsx` — "Add to
    Calendar" affordance with two design-language variants (glass = student
    pill, toolbar = teacher emerald), disabled-on-empty, focus ring, active
    scale, compatibility tooltip, sonner success/error toasts.
  - Student toolbar (My Class row) exports the personal class schedule
    (42 events, toast verified). Teacher My-Timetable ModuleToolbar action
    exports their teaching cells (14 events, matches Periods/Week stat,
    toast verified). Sample artifact: download/sample-timetable-export.ics.
- **NEW FEATURE — Public site SEO/OG metadata pass** (layout.tsx): title
  template, expanded keywords, applicationName/category, canonical, full
  openGraph (type/siteName/url/images with dims + alt), twitter
  summary_large_image, robots with googleBot max-image-preview, and a
  Viewport export with light/dark themeColor matched to the app palette
  (#f9fdfa / #06140f). Generated a branded 1344×768 OG image (emerald
  enterprise aesthetic) via z-ai image CLI → public/og-image.jpg; verified
  served 200 image/jpeg and all og:/twitter:/theme-color tags present in
  the rendered HTML.
- **GOTCHA FIXED**: lucide-react in this repo has NO `CalendarDown` export —
  Turbopack build failed (tsc did NOT catch it; loose module typing).
  Switched to `CalendarPlus`. LESSON: after icon-name edits, verify with
  `curl /` (Turbopack compile) in addition to tsc.
- **QA process notes**: agent-browser @refs go stale across re-renders —
  prefer DOM eval clicks (`document.querySelectorAll` + find by text +
  .click()) for this SPA; `[role=tab]` exists in multiple widgets (scope by
  container); server restarts mid-session trigger VersionGuard reloads that
  invalidate in-flight evals — re-query after any Fast Refresh cycle.
  Login-portal flow: public site → "Login Portal" button → role chip →
  Sign In (hash URL #portal alone does not re-enter the portal view).
- Infra events this round: one OOM during first-compile-with-browser (known
  structural issue; keepalive recovered; re-warmed chunks before continuing).
  Login via API for server-side endpoint tests: POST /api/auth/login with
  {"email","password"} (NOT "identifier").

Stage Summary:
- Student Timetable BUG FIXED (server-truth rewiring; the module now shows the
  real enrollment-scoped schedule + real master sheet).
- Two new user-visible capabilities: .ics calendar export for Student + Teacher
  timetables, and a complete SEO/OG metadata surface for the public site.
- Gates: tsc 0 errors ✓ · lint clean ✓ · robots 200 ✓ · og-image 200 ✓ ·
  zero console errors in QA windows · dev.log clean.

## Current project status (end of round 3)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded), all 319 chunks warmed, DB in
  sync, disk ~6.6G free, event-stream :3003 running.
- All four roles remain browser-verified end-to-end; the student Timetable is
  now server-backed (was the one module on stale client-seed data).
- Zero tsc errors, zero lint errors, no dead code, no duplicate files.

## Current goals / verification results (round 3)

- ✅ Student Timetable empty-state bug diagnosed + fixed (label universes
  reconciled by moving the module to the server truth)
- ✅ NEW /api/student/timetable (enrollment-scoped, permission-modeled)
- ✅ NEW ICS export (shared RFC 5545 builder + shared button, student +
  teacher, verified in browser with toasts; sample in download/)
- ✅ NEW SEO/OG metadata + generated OG image (tags verified in served HTML)
- ✅ Loading / error / stale states for the student timetable (skeleton,
  retry card, amber stale banner)
- ✅ Gates green: tsc 0, lint clean, robots 200, og 200

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (unchanged, structural)**: bursts of ≤6 module
   loads on a fresh server are safe; longer sessions or bursts on a loaded
   server OOM (self-heals in ~5-60s). This round reproduced it once during
   first-compile-with-browser; re-warming chunks fixed it.
2. **Icon-name trap**: tsc does not catch missing lucide-react exports —
   always `curl /` (or check dev.log) after touching icon imports.
3. **Principal Timetable editor still operates on the client store universe**
   ("Class 2-A"… labels), which no longer matches what students/teachers see
   (DB rows). Next-phase candidate: rewire the Principal Timetable module to
   the DB (read + publish) so the whole timetable pipeline is one universe.
4. Other next-phase candidates: timetable ICS export for the principal view,
   superadmin platform activity feed merging ActivityLog + payments +
   sessions (16/15/318 rows exist), public-site news/announcements RSS,
   principal fee-defaulter outreach workflow, keepalive "recycle" subcommand.
5. The ICS fold() counts UTF-16 code units, not octets — lines with many
   multibyte chars could theoretically exceed 75 octets; current content
   (ASCII + a few · separators) stays far below; all parsers tolerate it.

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA, fix discovered gaps, then
feature + styling development (mandates: more features, more styling detail).

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT**: all gates green at start (tsc 0 / lint 0 / robots 200 /
  stream 200 / 6.7G disk). QA burst targeted the top known architectural debt:
  the Principal Timetable editor still operating on the client-store seed
  universe ("Class 2-A"…, 54 slots, 5 classes) while students/teachers read the
  DB (Grade 9 - A / Grade 10 - A, 78 rows) — confirmed in the browser: the
  principal's publishes could never reach any student or teacher view.
- **FEATURE — Timetable pipeline unified on ONE data universe (Principal ↔ DB)**:
  - `src/lib/timetable/config.ts` — removed 'use client' (pure constants) so
    client components AND server route handlers share the one period ladder.
  - NEW `src/lib/timetable/server-mapping.ts` — the shared bidirectional
    DB ⇄ TimetableSlot mapping (teaching-period numbers ↔ ladder periods via
    start-time matching with positional fallbacks; "HH:MM" ↔ ladder-style range
    strings). The student module's server-slots.ts became a re-export shim
    (dedup: both directions use ONE algorithm).
  - REWROTE `GET /api/timetable` to the flat ServerSlot shape (no prior
    consumers) with class labels resolved server-side.
  - NEW `POST /api/timetable/publish` (PRINCIPAL-only, roles-guarded twice):
    shared mapping → resolve classes/subjects by name (create genuinely-new
    ones) → replace-all within the school (publish = the new truth) →
    ActivityLog audit entry (TIMETABLE_PUBLISHED). Validated: EMPTY_TIMETABLE
    and FORBIDDEN error paths; live 78-row round-trip with ZERO drift (lost 0 /
    gained 0) and no duplicate Class/Subject rows created.
  - Store: NEW `hydrateFromServer(slots)` action (replaces slots +
    publishedSlots, clears pending; no-op on empty).
  - Principal `index.tsx`: mount-time hydration from /api/timetable (unknown
    teachers get STABLE synthetic ids `srv-<name-slug>` — never '' — so
    conflict detection sees distinct people: conflicts went 22 → 0, faculty
    2 → 4); dynamic classOptions/roomOptions derived from live slots (was
    static CLASSES/ROOMS — hydrated classes would have vanished from the grid
    and filters); selectedClass default 'all'; publish now syncs to the server
    with an honest failure path (toast.warning "Published locally — server
    sync failed" + retry).
  - FiltersBar / ScheduleGrid / AutoTimetableDialog / overview-cards: accept
    live class/room options (static lists only as fallback); "Across N classes"
    count now derived from the schedule; removed an unused CLASSES import.
- **END-TO-END PROOF (browser, full pipeline)**: principal → Edit → removed
  "Physics · Grade 10 - A · Monday Period 1" → Apply Changes → Publish →
  toast "1 change shared with affected users · 77 server slots across 2
  classes" → DB verified (77 rows; Grade 10-A Monday starts P2) → student API
  verified (masterSlots reflect the removal) → original 78-row state restored
  via the publish API (rows back to 78, Monday P1 present). The Principal now
  publishes and the whole school actually sees it.
- **NEW FEATURE — Super Admin Platform Activity Feed (real server records)**:
  - NEW `GET /api/superadmin/activity` (SUPER_ADMIN-only): merges ActivityLog
    (with user + school names), successful Payments (student/class/method),
    and Sessions (compact device label via parseUserAgent — "Chrome · Linux ·
    Desktop", "(API)" for curl) into one newest-first timeline (take 30).
  - NEW `superadmin/modules/activity-feed.tsx` — Panel with refresh action,
    staggered loading skeleton, honest error + retry, empty state, hairline
    ledger rows (kind icon chip · actor · summary · school badge · relative
    timestamp), max-h-96 scroll area. Wired into the Overview below the tenant
    change log (mock control plane vs REAL records — now visually adjacent).
    The feed already shows this round's TIMETABLE_PUBLISHED entries live.
- **STYLING**: data-lineage chips on the principal timetable header — emerald
  pulsing "Synced with school records" / amber "Local snapshot (server
  unreachable)" / muted "Syncing…" (aria-live); publish toast now carries real
  server counts; activity-feed ledger rhythm matches the tenant panels.
- **QA process notes**: this round reproduced the OOM crash-loop twice — the
  server died every ~30s WHILE the browser was attached (dmesg: next-server
  anon-rss 3.13GB). Recovery: close browser → keepalive restarts → re-warm →
  SHORT bursts. After source edits land mid-session, Fast Refresh remounts
  the SPA and resets viewState — redo portal navigation after the HMR cycles
  finish; Chrome caches the "site can't be reached" interstitial (fresh
  `agent-browser open`, never reload). Evals can hit the pre-hydration DOM
  right after `open` — wait 6-8s before asserting on button text.

Stage Summary:
- The timetable pipeline is ONE universe end-to-end: Principal edits/publishes
  → DB rows → Student + Teacher views (browser-proven with a live edit that
  propagated to the student-visible master timetable, then restored).
- Super Admin gained a REAL activity feed (staff actions + payments + sign-ins).
- Gates: tsc 0 errors ✓ · lint clean ✓ · robots 200 ✓ · stream 200 ✓ ·
  zero console errors in QA windows · dev.log clean.

## Current project status (end of round 4)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded, chunks re-warmed after every
  source batch), event-stream :3003 healthy, disk 6.6G free.
- All four roles browser-verified; the timetable domain is now fully connected
  across Principal → DB → Student/Teacher (was the largest known gap).
- Zero tsc errors, zero lint errors, no dead code, no duplicate files.

## Current goals / verification results (round 4)

- ✅ Principal Timetable hydrated from the server (78 real slots, 2 real
  classes, 0 conflicts, 4 faculty, sync chip)
- ✅ NEW POST /api/timetable/publish (permission-guarded, replace semantics,
  class/subject resolution, audit log; round-trip drift: zero)
- ✅ Full publish pipeline proven in the browser + student API, then restored
- ✅ NEW Super Admin activity feed (real ActivityLog/Payments/Sessions, styled
  ledger, loading/error/empty states) — renders live data including this
  round's publishes
- ✅ Styling: lineage chips, server-count toasts, ledger rhythm, skeletons
- ✅ Gates green: tsc 0, lint clean, robots 200, stream 200

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (unchanged, structural)**: OOM crash-loops
   reproduced twice this round while a browser was attached to a compiling
   server. The protocol (close browser → recover → warm → short bursts)
   works but costs time; keep bursts to login + ≤1 module.
2. **Timetable editor teacher picker is roster-bound**: hydrated slots whose
   teacher is not in the mock roster (Mrs. Kavita Sharma etc.) carry synthetic
   ids; editing such a slot requires re-picking a roster teacher. A future
   round could load teachers from the server (Teacher table) instead of mocks.
3. **Public-website + login metadataBase** is `http://localhost:3000`
   (sandbox-only; harmless here, set a real origin if ever deployed).
4. Next-phase candidates: teacher picker server-backed (Teacher table);
   principal timetable "publish" notification fan-out via the event-stream
   service (:3003) so open student tabs live-refresh without reload; the
   remaining store-seeded modules audit (any other module whose labels could
   disagree with server truth); fee-defaulter outreach workflow; public-site
   RSS for the notice board.
5. ActivityLog coverage is thin by design (only workflows that already log);
   consider adding activity logging to more principal workflows (fee
   reminders, certificate issuance) to enrich the superadmin feed.

## Operational runbook (for cron agents)

1. Read this worklog first. Check server: `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`
   (expect 200; if not, keepalive needs ≤60s — check `tail keepalive.log`).
2. Browser QA in SHORT bursts; close the browser between batches (`agent-browser close`).
   PROVEN PROTOCOL (Task 5): bursts survive ~6 module loads on a FRESH server only. Before each
   burst: close browser → `for p in $(pgrep -f "bun run dev"; pgrep -f "next dev -p 3000";
   pgrep -f "next-server"); do kill -9 $p; done` → wait ~25s (keepalive restarts) → robots:200
   → burst → close. A loaded server (~2.8GB RSS) + browser will OOM within 1-2 module loads.
3. If a module click leaves a blank page: the server restarted mid-load — reload the page after the
   server is healthy again.
4. Login helper: /tmp/qa-lib.sh may be gone; recreate from this worklog's credentials section or use
   agent-browser fill/click directly on the Login Portal.
5. After ANY code change: run `bunx tsc --noEmit` and `bun run lint`; then re-warm chunks/APIs if routes
   or imports changed structurally.
6. AFTER EDITING SOURCE FILES, always: close browser → wait for server health → run
   `bash /home/z/.qa/warm-chunks.sh` (re-fetches the new chunk hashes; ~2 min) → THEN browser QA.
   Skipping this recompiles edited chunks with the browser attached → OOM restart loop.
7. Radix UI tabs need full pointer-event dispatch to activate synthetically:
   pointerdown → mousedown → pointerup → mouseup → click. Plain .click() works only on plain buttons.
8. In some headless sessions document.innerText returns "" for rendered pages — use textContent
   (or check specific elements) instead of innerText for content assertions.
9. Chrome caches its own "site can't be reached" interstitial — if a reload shows blank text, do a
   fresh `agent-browser open` instead of `reload`.
10. ICON TRAP (Task 6): tsc does NOT catch missing lucide-react exports (loose module typing) —
    after touching icon imports, verify with `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/`
    (500 = Turbopack import error; check dev.log for the exact export name). Available calendar icons
    here: CalendarPlus/CalendarCheck/CalendarClock… but NOT CalendarDown.
11. SPA clicking (Task 6): agent-browser @refs go stale across re-renders — prefer DOM eval clicks:
    `agent-browser eval '(() => { for (const x of document.querySelectorAll("nav button")) if (x.textContent.trim() === "Timetable") { x.click(); return "ok" } return "none" })()'`.
    Wrap in an IIFE (top-level consts persist between evals and redeclare-error). Scope [role=tab]
    queries by container (several widgets have tabs). Server restarts mid-session trigger VersionGuard
    reloads — re-query elements after any Fast Refresh cycle.
12. Server-side endpoint tests: POST /api/auth/login expects {"email","password"} (not "identifier");
    cookie jar via curl -c/-b, then GET the API under test and assert the {ok:true,data} envelope.
13. OOM CRASH-LOOP (Task 7, reproduced twice): when a browser is attached while the server still
    needs to compile (fresh server + first page/modules), the server dies every ~30s
    (dmesg: next-server anon-rss ~3.1GB) and Chrome caches the "site can't be reached"
    interstitial. Protocol: `agent-browser close` → wait for keepalive (robots:200, ~30s) →
    `bash /home/z/.qa/warm-chunks.sh` → fresh `agent-browser open` (NEVER reload — the
    interstitial is cached) → burst = login + ≤1 module → close. Prefer curl-based API tests
    over browser clicks whenever the assertion does not need rendering.
14. FAST-REFRESH REMOUNTS (Task 7): source edits landing while a browser is attached trigger
    HMR that remounts the SPA — page.tsx viewState resets to the public website and refs/evals
    go stale mid-flow. After any edit → warm first, then re-login. Also: right after
    `agent-browser open`, the DOM may be pre-hydration (buttons render with no text) —
    wait 6-8s before eval-based assertions.

Task ID: 8
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 5 — 2026-09-19)

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA, then feature + styling
development (mandates: more features, more styling detail).

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT**: all gates green at start (robots 200 / stream 200 /
  tsc 0 / lint 0 / 6.7G disk). QA bursts verified round-4 surfaces still
  healthy: Principal Timetable (sync chip, 78 real slots, real classes) and
  Super Admin activity feed ("School records activity", 30 real rows).
  No bugs found → proceeded to feature development.
- **NEW FEATURE 1 — Timetable publish LIVE fan-out (event-stream)**:
  - `mini-services/event-stream/index.ts`: poll source #4 — ActivityLog rows
    (action=TIMETABLE_PUBLISHED) → `school-event` frames with NEW kind
    `timetable` (title "Timetable updated", detail carries slot counts +
    actor name, schoolId-scoped); watermark query extended. Service
    auto-restarted via bun --hot; verified by log line
    `[event-stream] timetable → 78 slots across 2 classes (replaced 78 rows) (Dr. Ananya Iyer)`.
  - `live-feed-store.ts`: kind union + `timetableVersion` counter (bumped on
    every timetable push) — modules detect "changed since I loaded" without
    polling.
  - `app-shell.tsx`: handles the timetable kind — amber-accent premium toast
    (CalendarCheck icon chip + LIVE pill), bell entry (type TIMETABLE),
    live-feed mirror. `notifications-dropdown.tsx`: TIMETABLE icon branch
    (CalendarCheck, amber tones). `live-activity-ticker.tsx`: KIND_META
    timetable entry (principal dashboard ticker).
  - Student `timetable/index.tsx` + teacher `my-timetable.tsx`: watch
    `timetableVersion` (baseline set at first load); on a NEW publish →
    quiet background refetch (skeleton only renders pre-first-load, so an
    open tab never flashes) + emerald "Updated · live" chip (pulsing Radio
    dot, role=status aria-live, tooltip) in the toolbar.
  - **END-TO-END PROOF (browser)**: student tab open via the GATEWAY origin →
    curl no-op round-trip publish (78→78, zero drift) → within ~5s the toast
    "Timetable updated [Live] 78 slots across 2 classes (replaced 78 rows) ·
    by Dr. Ananya Iyer" + the "Updated · live" chip appeared; bell shows the
    unread TIMETABLE entry. Screenshots:
    download/qa-round5-student-live-refresh.png.
- **NEW FEATURE 2 — Public notice board RSS feed**:
  - NEW `GET /api/public/notices/rss` — RSS 2.0 (xmlns:atom), same source as
    the public notice board (audience ALL/STUDENTS/PUBLIC, latest 15):
    XML-escaped titles/descriptions, RFC 822 pubDates, stable GUIDs, priority
    tags ([URGENT]/[HIGH]), atom:link self, graceful empty-feed fallback when
    the DB is down. Verified via curl — real notices render (Unit Test 2,
    Hydroponics Club, Mid-Term Results…).
  - Public site notice board header: amber-hover "RSS feed" chip (Rss icon,
    a11y label, focus ring, hover lift) linking to the feed.
  - `layout.tsx` metadata: `alternates.types["application/rss+xml"]` —
    RSS autodiscovery from every page's <head>.
- **NEW FEATURE 3 — Server-backed teacher picker (Principal timetable)**:
  - NEW `src/lib/store/teacher-roster-store.ts` — client zustand store,
    mock-seeded for instant paint, `ensure()` fetches GET /api/teachers
    (idempotent, in-flight guard) → REAL Teacher rows (id, employeeId,
    department, derived initials avatar, comma-split subjects); source
    'server'|'mock' for honest lineage.
  - Rewired ALL 7 mock-teacher consumers in the timetable module:
    index.tsx (hydration awaits roster+timetable in parallel → ids consistent
    from the start; change summaries; save handler), slot-editor-dialog.tsx
    (picker options + "live" micro-badge on the Teacher label),
    filters-bar.tsx (faculty filter), overview-cards.tsx ("of N on roster"),
    auto-timetable-dialog.tsx (roster-driven subject→teacher map: mock-id
    names + server subject codes MATH/PHY/ENG… via SUBJECT_CODE_TO_NAME,
    general-pool fallback so small rosters still generate), schedule-grid.tsx
    + timetable-pdf.ts (imperative teacherNameById).
  - **Verified in browser**: "Faculty roster · 4 live" teal lineage chip next
    to the sync chip; slot editor picker lists the REAL DB faculty (Mrs.
    Kavita Sharma DEMO-T-001 · Mathematics, Rohan Mehta GWS-T-014,
    Ms. Priya Iyer DEMO-T-003, Mr. Arjun Nair DEMO-T-002) with the live
    badge. Screenshot: download/qa-round5-teacher-picker-live.png +
    qa-round5-principal-roster-chip.png.
- **STYLING DETAILS shipped with the features**: amber timetable toast
  accent + CalendarCheck chips; emerald "Updated · live" pills (student
  glass + teacher toolbar variants); teal "Faculty roster · N live" lineage
  chip; "live" micro-badge in the slot editor; amber-hover RSS chip on the
  public site; TIMETABLE bell icon branch.
- **QA/INFRA LESSONS (important for next rounds)**:
  1. **Gateway-origin testing**: agent-browser must open the app via
     `http://localhost:81` (the Caddy gateway), NOT localhost:3000 — the
     socket.io URL `/?XTransformPort=3003` only forwards through the gateway.
     A localhost:3000 page silently fails the socket (fetch test returned the
     Next.js HTML instead of the engine.io handshake). Real users always come
     through the gateway, so :81 is the honest test origin.
  2. **Fresh-server burst discipline (refined)**: after source edits, warm
     chunks AND pre-warm the API routes the burst will hit (curl login + the
     module endpoints — API routes compile on demand in dev and an
     on-demand compile with Chrome attached OOMs). Then kill the tree →
     keepalive restart → verify LOW RSS (~400MB) → burst. A server that
     already compiled `/` retains ~2.8-3GB and dies with the browser attached.
  3. **Portal login flakiness**: right after `agent-browser open` on a fresh
     compile, the first "Open Login Portal" click can be swallowed by the
     settling page — re-query buttons and redo the click sequence (portal →
     chip → Sign In) if chips are missing. The Student quick-access chip
     autofills student1@demoschool.edu (a real seeded account — different
     from aarav.sharma; both work).
- **Gates**: `bunx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors ✓ · `bun run lint` clean ✓ ·
  robots 200 ✓ · stream 200 ✓ · dev.log clean ✓ · disk 6.6G free ✓.
  NOTE: tsc needs `NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=1500` (900MB cap OOMs —
  the codebase needs ~890MB+).

Stage Summary:
- The timetable pipeline is now LIVE end-to-end: Principal publishes →
  open student/teacher tabs get the broadcast in ≤5s (toast + bell +
  auto-refresh + chip) — browser-proven through the real gateway path.
- Public notice board is subscribable (RSS 2.0 + autodiscovery).
- The principal's timetable editor now operates on the school's REAL teacher
  roster (7 consumers rewired to one server-backed store).

## Current project status (end of round 5)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded), event-stream :3003 healthy
  with the new timetable broadcast source, all chunks warmed, DB in sync,
  disk 6.6G free.
- All four roles remain browser-verified; three new user-visible capabilities
  shipped and verified end-to-end this round.
- Zero tsc errors, zero lint errors, no dead code, no duplicate files.

## Current goals / verification results (round 5)

- ✅ Round-4 surfaces re-verified (principal timetable hydration, superadmin
  activity feed with 30 live rows)
- ✅ NEW live timetable broadcast: publish → toast + bell + auto-refresh +
  "Updated · live" chip on open student tabs (gateway-origin browser proof)
- ✅ NEW RSS feed: valid RSS 2.0 with real notices + autodiscovery + chip
- ✅ NEW server-backed teacher picker: real DB faculty in the editor,
  roster lineage chip, auto-scheduler on the real roster
- ✅ Styling: five new chip/toast/badge surfaces in the established design
  language
- ✅ Gates green: tsc 0 (with 1500MB cap), lint clean, robots 200, stream 200

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (unchanged, structural)**: this round reproduced
   the OOM crash-loop twice during browser bursts on loaded servers. The
   refined protocol (warm chunks + pre-warm APIs via curl → kill tree →
   fresh low-RSS server → burst via :81) worked reliably. Budget ~5 min per
   browser burst cycle.
2. **RSS feed origin**: the feed's <link>/self URLs use localhost:3000
   (matches the app's metadataBase — sandbox-only; set a real origin if
   deployed).
3. **Auto-timetable general-pool fallback**: subjects with no dedicated
   roster teacher now fall back to any free teacher (better than empty
   periods on a small roster). If undesired for big schools, gate it behind
   roster size.
4. Next-phase candidates: principal "publish" also bumps a PUBLISHED banner
   on the principal's own dashboard ticker (currently only students/teachers
   refresh); superadmin activity feed already shows TIMETABLE_PUBLISHED rows
   (enriched by this round's publishes); fee-defaulter outreach workflow;
   event-stream broadcast for fee-reminder sends; per-role notification
   preferences.
5. The student quick-access chip account (student1@demoschool.edu) differs
   from the worklog's documented aarav.sharma credentials — both are real
   seeded students; document or unify if it confuses future QA.

Task ID: 9
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 6 — 2026-09-19)

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA, then feature + styling
development (mandates: more features, more styling detail).

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT**: all gates green at start (robots 200 / stream 200 /
  tsc 0 / lint 0 / 6.6G disk). Pre-warmed APIs via curl, recycled to a fresh
  server, browser-burst verified round-5 surfaces: Principal Timetable
  (sync chip ✓, "Faculty roster · 4 live" ✓, 78 slots / 2 classes /
  0 conflicts ✓, full grid with real teachers/rooms); Super Admin activity
  feed (live rows incl. this session's sign-ins) + student timetable via
  API. NO BUGS FOUND → proceeded to the top next-phase candidate.
- **NEW FEATURE — Fee-Defaulter Outreach Workflow (Principal → Students,
  live + audited)**:
  - NEW `GET /api/fees/defaulters` (PRINCIPAL/MANAGEMENT): server-truth
    aggregation over Fee rows where paid < amount, grouped per student —
    outstanding total, per-line breakdown, earliest due date, honest
    daysOverdue, guardian name/phone, lastRemindedAt (matched by the
    stable "Fee Reminder" subject prefix). Verified: 5 real defaulters,
    ₹105,400 outstanding, 4 overdue by 354 days.
  - NEW `POST /api/fees/defaulters/remind`: for each selected student with
    dues — anti-spam guard (recipients of a reminder in the last 24h are
    SKIPPED, reported honestly), a personalized Message row (subject
    "Fee Reminder — ₹X outstanding", body with line-by-line breakdown +
    due dates + payment guidance + real signature), one FEE_REMINDER_SENT
    ActivityLog audit row. Verified: single send, retry-skip, empty-body
    validation ("Select at least one student"), message content in DB.
  - NEW `fees-defaulters.tsx` — "Outreach" tab in Fee Management (always
    present, after Student Accounts; keyboard shortcuts extended 1-6 → 1-9):
    4 KPI SummaryCards (Total Outstanding rose / Students With Dues amber /
    Past Due Date rose / Reminded This Week sky), status filter chips
    (All/Past due/Due soon) + class filter + student search, ledger table
    with initials avatars, guardian contact, ₹ outstanding, due chips
    (rose "Nd overdue" / amber "in Nd" / date), "reminded Xm ago" column,
    expandable per-student fee lines (AnimatePresence), select-all +
    per-row checkboxes with emerald row tint, animated selection bar
    ("N selected · ₹X outstanding total"), and a preview dialog rendering
    the EXACT message text with real school/principal names (fetched from
    /api/auth/me — same values the endpoint uses) + recipient roll-up +
    anti-spam note; all states honest (staggered loading skeleton, error +
    retry, celebratory all-settled empty, filtered-empty).
  - **Live fan-out reuses the existing message broadcast**: a socket test
    client received EXACTLY 1 frame per sent message → open student tabs
    get the toast + bell entry within seconds (event-stream source #3).
  - **Super Admin feed enriched automatically**: 4 "Fee reminder sent"
    rows (kind staff) now visible in /api/superadmin/activity.
- **STYLING/CONNECTIVITY — Overview entry points to Outreach**
  (`fees-overview.tsx`): "Students With Dues" KPI card now navigates to
  the Outreach tab (sub: "across N classes · reminders ready"); the
  "Outstanding Dues" panel gained an emerald "Send reminders" action
  (Send icon, emerald border/hover tones) beside "View accounts".
  Browser-verified: both navigate to the Outreach tab with live data.
- **END-TO-END PROOF (browser, gateway origin)**: principal → Outreach
  tab → KPIs + 5 real rows → expanded Pari Iyer's fee lines (Tuition Fee
  Q1, due 30 Sep 2025) → selected Aadhya + Pari → selection bar "2
  selected · ₹50,000 outstanding total" → preview dialog ("Dear Aadhya
  Patel (Grade 10 - A)" + "…and 1 more: Pari Iyer") → Send 2 Reminders →
  dialog closed + data refreshed (both rows "Xm ago", never=0) → DB
  verified (2 messages + activity row "2 fee reminders · ₹50,000") →
  socket client confirmed 1 frame per message.
- **INFRA EVENTS (resolved)**:
  1. event-stream :3003 had died; my restart attempt failed (port still
     held by the live process — the pgrep pattern "event-stream" doesn't
     match `bun --hot index.ts`; use `lsof -i :3003`). Clean-restarted
     with a fresh log; direct + gateway 200.
  2. event-stream log showed 3× duplicate broadcast lines per message —
     fd artifact of two processes writing one truncated log (my failed
     restart), NOT duplicate emissions: a live socket client received
     exactly 1 frame per message. Fixed by the clean restart.
  3. Browser stuck at the mounted-gate skeleton after a Fast-Refresh
     cycle: Chrome had cached a broken RSC response. FIX: fresh
     `agent-browser open` with a CACHE-BUSTING query (`http://localhost:81/?fresh=1`)
     — full render immediately. Add to the runbook.
  4. Dev server recycled (kill tree → keepalive) before each browser
     burst per protocol; chunks re-warmed after every source batch
     (319→321 chunks).
- **DATA STATE (intentional, for future QA)**: all 5 demo defaulters have
  now been reminded — 5 "Fee Reminder" Message rows + 4 FEE_REMINDER_SENT
  ActivityLog rows exist. The 24h anti-spam window locks further sends to
  these students until ~2026-09-20 04:50 UTC (sends then report "skipped
  (reminded in the last 24h)" — honest). New sends work for any student
  with dues outside the window.
- **Gates**: `bunx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors ✓ (1500MB cap) · `bun run lint`
  clean ✓ · robots 200 ✓ · stream 200 ✓ · dev.log clean ✓ · zero console
  errors in QA windows ✓. Screenshots: download/qa-round6-outreach-tab.png,
  qa-round6-outreach-all-reminded.png, qa-round6-outreach-entry.png,
  qa-round6-overview-buttons.png.

Stage Summary:
- The fee pipeline is now TWO-WAY end-to-end: Principal sees real
  defaulters → sends personalized reminders → students get live toasts +
  Messages inbox entries → Super Admin sees the audit trail. All
  browser-proven through the gateway path.
- Styling mandate: 4-tone KPI strip, due chips, expandable ledger rows,
  animated selection bar, message preview dialog, emerald overview entry
  points — all in the established fees design language.
- Gates green; no dead code; one new API pair + one new component + two
  surgical overview edits.

## Current project status (end of round 6)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded, 321 chunks warmed),
  event-stream :3003 healthy (clean log, direct + gateway 200), DB in
  sync, disk 6.6G free, tsc 0 / lint 0.
- All four roles browser-verified across rounds; the fee domain now has
  a complete outreach loop (the #1 candidate from rounds 3–5).

## Current goals / verification results (round 6)

- ✅ QA assessment: round-5 surfaces healthy, no bugs found
- ✅ NEW fee-defaulter outreach: GET/POST APIs + Outreach tab + live
  fan-out + audit trail, all verified end-to-end in the browser
- ✅ NEW Overview entry points (KPI card + Outstanding Dues panel action)
- ✅ Anti-spam guard + validation + honest skip reporting verified
- ✅ Super Admin activity feed enriched with real FEE_REMINDER rows
- ✅ Gates: tsc 0, lint clean, robots 200, stream 200

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling (unchanged, structural)**: browser bursts on
   fresh servers remain the safe protocol; budget ~5 min per burst cycle.
   NEW runbook item: if the browser sticks at the mounted-gate skeleton
   after HMR cycles, open with a cache-busting query (`/?fresh=1`).
2. **event-stream pgrep**: the service process matches `bun --hot
   index.ts`, NOT "event-stream" — use `lsof -i :3003` to find/kill it.
3. **24h reminder anti-spam lock on demo data** (until ~2026-09-20
   04:50 UTC): future QA sends to the 5 seeded defaulters report honest
   skips; create a new Fee row (POST /api/fees) to test fresh sends.
4. Next-phase candidates: student-side Fees banner surfacing the latest
   reminder (currently the loop closes via Messages/bell); principal
   dashboard "Principal Attention" fee alert → deep-link to Outreach;
   per-role notification preferences UI; keepalive "recycle" subcommand;
   certificates-issuance activity logging (more superadmin feed richness).

Task ID: 10
Agent: Z.ai Code (cron webDevReview round 7 — 2026-09-19)

Task: Full-status assessment + agent-browser QA, then fix-first development
(QA found a data-consistency bug) + two new features + styling detail
(mandates: more features, more styling).

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT**: all gates green at start (robots 200 / stream 200 /
  tsc 0 / lint 0 / 6.4G disk). Browser QA (principal) re-verified round-6
  surfaces (Fees Overview entry points, Outreach tab, Principal Attention
  feed). NO crashes or broken flows — but a **data-consistency bug class**
  found: three contradictory dues stories across surfaces (Dashboard KPI
  mock "₹1.84 Cr / 142 students"; Fees Overview ledger "₹2.05 L / 56";
  Outreach server-truth "₹1.05 L / 5"). The bridges (KPI → Outreach) showed
  mismatched numbers → fixed this round + 2 features from the next-phase
  candidates list.
- **CONSISTENCY FIX — one live dues truth for every Outreach-facing surface**:
  - NEW `GET /api/fees/defaulters?summary=1` — lightweight aggregate mode
    (totalOutstanding, defaulterCount, overdueCount, remindedThisWeek,
    classesWithDues, top defaulter, asOf); full per-student ledger skipped
    for KPI consumers.
  - NEW `src/lib/store/dues-summary-store.ts` — ensure()/refresh() zustand
    store, idempotent in-flight guard, 60s freshness window, honest lineage
    (`status==='server'` only after a successful sync).
  - Dashboard `kpi-row.tsx` "Pending Fees": server-truth value + sub
    ("5 students · 4 past due") + LIVE chip (new `chip` prop on the shared
    SummaryCard) + mock sparkline dropped when live (no fake trend under a
    real number) + deep-link to the Outreach tab (focus-store type
    'fee-outreach', handled by a new effect in fees-shell.tsx).
  - Fees Overview KPI 4 "Students With Dues": server count + "across N
    classes · ₹X outstanding" + LIVE chip. Ledger cards stay ledger-scoped
    (Outstanding → accounts; subtitle now "25 ledger accounts · largest
    balances"; "Send reminders · 5 live" count bridge on the panel action).
  - NEW shared `live-chip.tsx` (pulsing emerald lineage pill, a11y title).
- **NEW FEATURE — Principal Attention LIVE fee alert** (candidate #2):
  NEW `live-fee-alert.tsx` pinned above the simulated alert rows — REAL
  server dues ("5 students owe ₹1,05,400 · 4 past due · 5 reminded this
  week · largest Ananya Gupta ₹25.0K"), rose/amber gradient stripe by
  urgency, LIVE pill, "1 live" hint in the panel subtitle, one click →
  Outreach deep-link. Browser-verified end-to-end.
- **NEW FEATURE — Student fee-reminder banner** (candidate #1):
  - `/api/student/dashboard` feesSection now joins the latest "Fee Reminder"
    Message row (subject/excerpt/createdAt/senderName; queried only when
    outstanding > 0). types.ts DashboardFees extended.
  - NEW `fee-reminder-banner.tsx` at the top of the student dashboard:
    "Fee reminder from Dr. Ananya Iyer" + NEW pill (<48h) + relative stamp
    + the principal's actual excerpt + ₹ outstanding chip + dueLabel +
    "View message" (→ Messages) + "Pay fees" (→ Fees) + session dismiss X.
  - **Live refresh**: useStudentDashboard watches the live-feed ring — a new
    message broadcast (AppShell already recipient-filters) triggers a
    debounced QUIET refetch (no skeleton flash; errors stay quiet too).
  - END-TO-END PROOF (gateway origin): student tab open → principal sends 2
    normal messages via API → dashboard fetch count 1→2 within seconds +
    unread count 3→5 live. Banner + CTAs browser-verified.
- **STYLING shipped**: LIVE chips on 2 KPI cards; pinned alert (gradient
  stripe, icon chip, hover affordance, a11y label); "1 live" subtitle;
  amber→rose banner with watermark icon, NEW pulse pill, due chips, dual
  CTAs; live-count bridge on the Send reminders button; ledger-scoped
  subtitle.
- **QA/INFRA — ROOT CAUSE of the crash loop found and documented**: the
  ~45s dev-server restart loop during browser QA was **zombie Chrome
  processes**: `agent-browser close` leaves ~14 chrome procs (~700MB) that,
  with the 3GB warm dev server, push the 4GB cgroup into OOM
  (dmesg: oom-kill task=next-server anon-rss≈3.0GB). PROTOCOL UPDATE:
  after every `agent-browser close`, run `pkill -9 -f chrome` and verify
  `ps aux | grep -c "[c]hrome"` → 0. Also: pre-warm the app-shell's poll
  routes too (/api/auth/me, /api/notifications-feed, /api/app-version) —
  not just the module endpoints — before attaching the browser.
- **DATA STATE (intentional, for future QA)**: 2 realistic test messages
  sent to student1@demoschool.edu ("Library book return", "Science fair
  registration" from Dr. Ananya Iyer) — they live in the Messages demo
  data. The 5 seeded defaulters remain under the 24h reminder anti-spam
  lock until ~2026-09-20 04:50 UTC.
- **Gates**: `bunx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors ✓ (1500MB cap) · `bun run lint`
  clean ✓ · robots 200 ✓ · stream 200 ✓ · disk 6.4G free ✓. Screenshots:
  download/qa-round7-principal-live-kpi.png, qa-round7-fees-overview-live.png,
  qa-round7-student-banner.png, qa-round7-live-refresh-proof.png.

Stage Summary:
- The fee domain now has ONE dues truth on every surface that links into
  Outreach (dashboard KPI, attention alert, overview KPI — all quoting the
  server aggregation the Outreach tab shows), with honest lineage chips.
- The outreach loop is now fully bidirectional: principal sends → student
  sees the reminder AT the top of their dashboard (banner + live refresh).
- Root-caused and documented the QA instability (zombie Chrome + OOM) with
  the updated protocol.

## Current project status (end of round 7)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive-guarded), event-stream :3003 healthy,
  DB in sync, disk 6.4G free, tsc 0 / lint 0, no dead code.
- All four roles browser-verified; the fee domain is consistent
  (live-vs-ledger explicitly labeled) and the outreach loop closes on the
  student dashboard.

## Current goals / verification results (round 7)

- ✅ QA assessment: round-6 surfaces healthy; dues data-inconsistency found
- ✅ FIX: server-truth dues on all Outreach-facing KPIs + lineage chips
- ✅ NEW: Principal Attention live fee alert with Outreach deep-link
- ✅ NEW: student fee-reminder banner + live message-driven refresh
- ✅ Gates green: tsc 0, lint clean, robots 200, stream 200

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox memory ceiling — PROTOCOL UPDATE (important)**: after every
   browser burst, `agent-browser close` + `pkill -9 -f chrome` (zombies
   cause the 45s OOM restart loop); pre-warm app poll routes (auth/me,
   notifications-feed, app-version) along with module APIs before
   reattaching. Budget ~5 min per burst cycle; keep bursts ≤3 interactions.
2. **Anti-spam lock on demo defaulters** (until ~2026-09-20 04:50 UTC):
   new reminder sends to the 5 seeded students will honestly skip; create a
   new Fee row (POST /api/fees) for a non-reminded student to test fresh
   sends + the banner's live NEW-pill path end-to-end.
3. The student Fees MODULE still renders the client mock ledger
   (DEMO_STUDENT_ID) while the dashboard is server-truth — intentional
   (module = ledger showcase, dashboard = live record) but a future round
   could server-truth the module's BalanceHero the same way.
4. Next-phase candidates: per-role notification preferences UI;
   certificates-issuance activity logging (superadmin feed richness);
   keepalive "recycle" subcommand (automate the warm→kill→restart burst
   prep); payment-event → dues-summary store auto-refresh (currently the
   60s window + manual refresh()).

Task ID: 11
Agent: Z.ai Code (round 8 — teacher Class Attendance upgrade — 2026-09-19)

Task: User request: "In the teachers role, the student attendance, UI and
little bit working and function. I think that needs improvement." → full
UI + functionality upgrade of the teacher Class Attendance module.

Work Log:
- **STATUS ASSESSMENT (start)**: gates green (robots 200 / stream 200 /
  tsc 0 / lint 0 / 6.5G disk / 0 chrome zombies). API-level QA of round-7
  surfaces: dues summary (5 defaulters · ₹105,400 · 4 overdue), student1
  fee-reminder banner data (₹5,400 + reminder from Dr. Ananya Iyer),
  superadmin activity feed (live sign-ins incl. this session). NOTE:
  the student quick-access chip account is student1@demoschool.edu /
  password123 (NOT student123 — documented in login-page/data.tsx).
- **API — attendance history slice**: GET /api/teacher/class-attendance/board
  extended with `history` — the last 10 MARKED school days for the class
  inside a 30-day lookback ending TODAY (today-anchored so the week strip
  knows about days after the viewed date). Per day: date, counts, present
  rate, per-student entries. Verified: 10 real days (11-student full days
  on 16/17 Sep + single-student seeded rows 4–12 Sep).
- **UI — date navigation**: prev/next chevrons + Today button around the
  date input (next/future disabled), unsaved-changes pulsing amber dot
  inside the Save button.
- **UI — week strip**: Mon–Sun chips of the viewed week (weekday letter +
  day number); emerald dot on marked days, primary dot on today,
  selected-day ring, future days disabled; click → select that date.
- **UI — count cards**: thin animated progress bar under each of the 4
  cards (share of total).
- **UI — roster rows**: last-5-marked-days status dots (emerald/rose/
  amber/info, tooltip per dot) + attendance-rate chip (emerald ≥90%,
  amber ≥75%, rose below; title "n/m present across last N marked days");
  P/A/L/L legend added to the footer.
- **FEATURE — Insights view** (segmented Roster | Insights on the roster
  card): headline average present rate across the window + window line;
  10-day daily-present-rate bar chart (tone by rate, tooltip with full
  counts); "Attention needed" top-5 absentees (avatar, absences/late/
  leave breakdown, rate chip); "Perfect record" students (n/n ✓ chips);
  honest empty state when no marked days.
- **UX — dirty-discard notices**: switching class or date with unsaved
  changes now toasts "Unsaved changes discarded".
- **INFRA INCIDENT (fixed this round)**: a mid-round sandbox reset DELETED
  keepalive.mjs + keepalive.log from the project root and killed the
  watchdog (dev server died with nothing to revive it). ALSO discovered
  the old keepalive's `pgrep -f "bun run dev"` liveness check FALSE-
  MATCHES the event-stream mini-service (its dev script is also
  `bun run dev`) — the revived v3 watchdog saw "dev process exists" and
  waited forever while :3000 was dead. RECREATED keepalive.mjs (v4):
  liveness = `execFile('pgrep', ['-f', 'next dev|next-server'])` — no
  bash wrapper (self-match trap), no event-stream match; header documents
  recreation from this worklog. Verified: detects dead server → spawns →
  healthy in 3s; survived two more OOM restarts during the QA bursts.
- **/home/z/.qa/ warm tooling is GONE** (same reset). Cache stayed intact
  (.next 1.2GB), so warming = curl `/` once (25s first, then cached) +
  the poll routes. If the cache is ever fully invalidated, recreate the
  chunk warmer per Task-5 notes.
- **BROWSER QA (gateway origin, two bursts, OOM recovered between)**:
  teacher login → Class Attendance: week strip M14–S20 rendered, count
  cards 11/11, roster 11 rows with dots + rate chips (Aarav 80%), marked
  Diya Patel ABSENT → Present 10/11 + Absent 1/11 + "Unsaved changes" →
  Save → toast "Attendance saved · Grade 9 - A · 10 present · 1 absent" +
  "In sync with the saved record" → prev-day nav (honest 18-Sep defaults)
  → back to today (saved state). Insights: avg 87% across 10 days, trend
  bars, Attention (Aarav 2 absences · 80%, Ananya 1 · 50%), Perfect
  record (8 students 2/2). Screenshots: download/qa-round8-attendance-
  roster.png, qa-round8-attendance-insights.png, qa-round8-attendance-
  saved.png. Zero console errors in verified windows; the one
  notifications-feed 500 was during the OOM window (200 with session
  after recovery).
- **DATA STATE (intentional, for future QA)**: 2026-09-19 baseline for
  Grade 9 - A was overwritten by QA save — Diya Patel now ABSENT
  (10 present · 1 absent, marked by Rohan Mehta). Today's week-strip dot
  is emerald.
- **Gates**: `bunx tsc --noEmit` 0 errors ✓ · `bun run lint` clean ✓ ·
  robots 200 ✓ · stream 200 ✓ · disk 7.1G free ✓.

Stage Summary:
- The teacher Class Attendance module is now one of the richest surfaces:
  week-aware date navigation, per-student recent history + rate context,
  live count bars, dirty-state affordances, and a real analytics view —
  all from ONE extended API (no extra round-trips).
- Infrastructure self-healing restored and hardened (keepalive v4 with
  the event-stream-safe liveness check); root-file deletion by the
  sandbox reset documented + mitigated.

## Current project status (end of round 8)

- Dev server :3000 healthy (keepalive v4 guarded), event-stream :3003
  healthy, DB in sync, tsc 0 / lint 0, disk 7.1G free, no chrome zombies.
- All four roles verified in earlier rounds; the teacher attendance
  module fully re-verified end-to-end this round (mark → save → insights).

## Current goals / verification results (round 8)

- ✅ User-reported surface (teacher student-attendance) upgraded: UI
  detail + history context + insights + navigation + guards
- ✅ History API verified with 10 real marked days
- ✅ Save/refresh/insights/date-nav browser-proven via the gateway
- ✅ keepalive v4 restored after sandbox reset (event-stream-safe)
- ✅ Gates green

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. **Sandbox resets are now deleting ROOT files too** (keepalive.mjs,
   keepalive.log, /home/z/.qa/*) — if the dev server seems dead with no
   watchdog, recreate keepalive.mjs (spec in its header + Task 11 log).
2. **Memory ceiling unchanged**: this round OOMed twice during browser
   bursts on loaded servers (root cause per Task 7: zombie chrome +
   compile spikes). Protocol remains: fresh server + warmed cache +
   short bursts + `pkill -9 -f chrome` after every close.
3. Attendance history only counts OFFICIAL baselines (Attendance rows);
   subject-teacher sessions are not in the dots/insights yet — a future
   round could layer subject sessions into the insights view.
4. Next-phase candidates (from round 7, unchanged): per-role notification
   preferences UI; certificates-issuance activity logging; payment-event
   → dues-summary store auto-refresh; keepalive "recycle" subcommand;
   absence-notice-to-guardians workflow off the new attendance save
   (Message rows + live fan-out, mirrors the fee-reminder pattern).

Task ID: 12
Agent: Z.ai Code (main orchestrator)
Task: LP-2 — Lesson Planner upgrade (user request): board-syllabus auto-fed
complete-session plans (CBSE / UP Board), very-easy custom topic authoring,
full UI/UX redesign with rich animations. Browser QA + gates + handover.

Work Log:
- Read worklog (rounds 1–8), mapped the lesson-planner module end-to-end:
  index.tsx orchestration, today-lesson hero, progress/map/upcoming panels,
  api.ts transport, src/lib/lesson-planner.ts server layer,
  prisma/curriculum-data.ts (the seeded NCERT source), lesson-schedule.ts
  scheduler, CurriculumTopic/LessonTopicCompletion prisma models.
- NEW src/lib/syllabus-templates.ts (~800 lines): master board-syllabus
  registry — CBSE 9/10 reuse the seeded NCERT structures verbatim (imported
  from prisma/curriculum-data.ts → exact name-matching when merging) + a
  "Revision and Assessment" enrichment unit per subject; NEW CBSE Computer
  Applications 9/10 (code 165); compact NCERT middle-school sets (6–8 ×
  Math/Science/English/Hindi/SST); UP_BOARD 9/10 (NCERT-based गणित/सामाजिक
  विज्ञान/English, COMBINED विज्ञान = भौतिकी+रसायन+जीव विज्ञान, custom
  गोधूलि हिंदी, computer) + 6–8. Matching: classLevelFor (digits + roman),
  subjectKeyFor (English + देवनागरी aliases, exact-match-wins so
  सामाजिक विज्ञान ≠ विज्ञान), normalizeTopicName (\p{M} preserved so
  Devanagari matras survive — fixed "व ज ञ न" bug), findSyllabusTemplate
  (board → template; ICSE/STATE/CUSTOM → null → manual-add empty state).
- Server (src/lib/lesson-planner.ts): AUTO-FEED — getLessonPlan
  instantiates the FULL board template when a class+subject has zero
  CurriculumTopics (best-effort, quiet failure); topicNo display now
  derived from schedule position; new SyllabusInfo payload (board badge,
  book label, per-unit coverage, missingTopics) + autoProvisioned flag;
  addCustomTopic (position-aware insert at end of unit / new unit append,
  orderIndex rewrite, sourceBoard CUSTOM), updateCustomTopic (rename/
  periods/description/move-to-existing-unit), deleteCustomTopic (completed
  topics protected), mergeSyllabusTemplate (adds ONLY missing template
  topics, idempotent). All mutations re-verify teacher assignment
  ownership (getTeachingAssignments ∩ ACTIVE CSA).
- NEW API routes: POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/teacher/lesson-planner/topics,
  POST /api/teacher/lesson-planner/syllabus (merge). Client api.ts gained
  addTopic/updateTopic/deleteTopic/mergeSyllabus + SyllabusInfo types.
- UI REDESIGN (7 files): shared.tsx (→ .tsx for JSX): LIST_STAGGER/
  LIST_ITEM variants, AnimatedBar (spring width), ConfettiBurst (16
  particles, no deps), unitAccent palette (6 hues cycled), dot/text status
  config, applyTopicRemoval optimistic helper; today-lesson.tsx: emerald
  gradient hero with blur atmosphere, animated SVG session-progress ring,
  AnimatePresence CTA morph (Mark Completed ⇄ Completed+Undo), confetti
  on complete, quiet footline; progress-panel.tsx: spring % counter,
  stats row (topics left / pace / teaching days), staggered per-unit bars
  in unit accents; curriculum-map.tsx → "Session Plan": accent unit
  badges, sticky headers + animated per-unit progress, animated check-glyph
  pop, today pulse ring, hover actions (Done/Undo + edit + delete w/
  AlertDialog), inline QuickAddRow per unit (motion height), "New unit"
  footer; syllabus-library.tsx (NEW): CBSE/UP badge, book label, coverage
  meter, unit coverage chips, missing-topic list w/ one-tap + quick-add,
  "Add all N", "Full syllabus covered" celebratory state, custom-topics
  footline; add-topic-sheet.tsx (NEW): side sheet, autofocus name (Enter
  submits), unit picker w/ inline "+ New unit", −/+ periods stepper w/
  teaching-day estimate, notes, emerald footer; upcoming-panel.tsx: date
  tiles (day + MMM, amber today), stagger, schedule-basis polish;
  index.tsx: full orchestration (all handlers w/ optimistic updates +
  toasts + refetch, autoProvisioned success toast, Add-topic toolbar
  action, honest no-template empty state w/ CTA).
- Demo showcase seed: prisma/seed-computer-apps.ts (idempotent, ran OK) —
  Computer Applications subject (CA165) + CSAs + Rohan's 3×/week
  computer-lab periods (9-A P8 Wed/Fri/Sat 14:45, 10-A P7 Wed/Fri/Sat
  14:00, room "Computer Lab") → first open of the planner AUTO-FEEDS the
  full 10-topic CBSE session plan live.
- API QA via curl (rohan.mehta@greenwood.edu.in / teacher123): assignments
  show 4 pairs (incl. Computer Applications); Computer 9-A plan GET →
  autoProvisioned:true, 10 topics/4 units, syllabus 10/10; math merge +2;
  custom add → position-correct; PATCH rename; DELETE ok; delete of a
  COMPLETED topic correctly rejected; FORBIDDEN on non-owned subject
  (Hindi) — permission gate works.
- Browser QA (gateway :81, short batches, memory protocol): teacher login →
  Lesson Planner → Grade 10-A Computer Applications auto-fed LIVE (hero,
  ring, units, plan, syllabus library all rendered — VLM-verified clean);
  Mark Completed → confetti + toast + Undo morph; inline quick-add
  ("Typing Speed Drill — Home Row"); sheet add w/ NEW UNIT "Enrichment
  Club"; edit rename; delete w/ confirm; subject switch → Mathematics →
  syllabus 17/19 → one-tap add → 18/19 → "Add all" → 19/19 "Full syllabus
  covered"; class switch → Grade 9-A Math 59%; mobile 390px single column,
  no overflow; dev.log: all lesson-planner APIs 200, zero errors.
- Gates: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean (after removing a
  stale eslint-disable); robots 200; no chrome zombies; memory protocol
  respected (fresh server + warmed compile + short bursts + pkill).

Stage Summary:
- USER REQUEST DELIVERED: "already a plan will be there you have to feed
  it, as per boards syllabus, whatever school will be cbse or up the plan
  will be automatically there for the complete session and if he want to
  add something, there should very easy to add plan also" —
  1) AUTO-FED COMPLETE-SESSION BOARD PLANS: opening any template-backed
     class+subject with no curriculum instantiates the full CBSE/UP-Board
     session plan (school.board decides; UP = NCERT-based + गोधूलि हिंदी
     + combined विज्ञान); 2) VERY EASY TO ADD: inline per-unit quick-add,
     one-tap syllabus merges, authoring sheet w/ new-unit flow; 3) UI/UX:
     gradient hero + animated ring + confetti, staggered session plan,
     syllabus library panel, spring bars everywhere.
- KEY FILES: src/lib/syllabus-templates.ts (NEW), lesson-planner.ts
  (extended), api/teacher/lesson-planner/{topics,syllabus}/route.ts (NEW),
  lesson-planner/{syllabus-library,add-topic-sheet}.tsx (NEW),
  shared.tsx/today-lesson/curriculum-map/progress-panel/upcoming-panel/
  index (rewritten), prisma/seed-computer-apps.ts (NEW, executed).
- Demo data: Computer Applications auto-feed showcase live in both grades;
  Math 9/10 plans now 19/19 syllabus coverage (enrichment merged);
  Computer 10-A carries a custom "Enrichment Club" unit (showcases the
  "+N custom topics" footline). 141→ preserved completions intact.
- Teacher credentials: rohan.mehta@greenwood.edu.in / teacher123.

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. UP_BOARD path is code-complete + unit-tested at the template level but
   NOT demo-visible (the demo school is CBSE). To showcase: create a
   second UP-BOARD tenant school (or flip a test school's board) and
   verify the गोधूलि/विज्ञान feed end-to-end.
2. Auto-feed anchors at session start (April 1) — a subject adopted
   mid-session honestly shows early topics as "Behind schedule" until the
   teacher marks completions; a future enhancement could offer "start
   schedule from adoption date".
3. Unit rename/delete (topics move only) not yet supported; edit-mode
   unit moves are limited to existing units.
4. Memory ceiling unchanged (this round needed the fresh-server +
   pre-compile-without-browser + short-bursts protocol twice); keep
   following it.
5. Next-phase candidates: principal-side syllabus adoption/preview panel
   (same template library); print/PDF export of the session plan;
   "behind schedule" catch-up assist (one-tap mark-previous-N-completed);
   the round-8 leftovers (notification preferences, payment auto-refresh).

Task ID: 11
Agent: Z.ai Code (exam duties rework — 2026-09-19)
Task: "Remove that exam duties module completely. In the exams the principal will assign teachers and they will receive a notification; also in the exams timetable teachers will see the duties. Not to do much but very natural, real and working."

Work Log:
- READ worklog + mapped the exam-duties landscape: teacher proctoring
  module (src/components/teacher/modules/exam-proctoring/ — 4 files,
  EP-6), /api/teacher/proctoring/* (5 routes), src/lib/exam-duty.ts,
  orphaned src/lib/mock/proctoring.ts, the 'proctoring' nav key +
  module-router entry + search-academic nav map, prisma models
  ExamDutyCompletion + ExamIncident (used ONLY by proctoring), and the
  existing-but-UI-less /api/exams/[id]/invigilator API.
- PHASE A (removal): deleted exam-proctoring/ (4 files), /api/teacher/
  proctoring/ (5 routes), lib/exam-duty.ts, mock/proctoring.ts; removed
  the nav item + lazy route + ClipboardCheck import; search-academic
  teacher exams key 'proctoring' → 'my-timetable'; prisma schema dropped
  ExamDutyCompletion + ExamIncident (+ their School/Student/Exam
  back-relations) → db push (tables dropped) → client regenerated;
  prisma/seed-exam-ops.ts incident seeding stripped. Zero dangling
  references (only legit position-permission labels remain).
- PHASE B (real assignment layer, src/lib/exams/service-extended.ts):
  assignInvigilator now (a) stores the teacher's USER id in
  invigilatorId — the exact convention every seeded row uses — with the
  name synced; (b) checks availability SCHOOL-WIDE (any exam, same day,
  overlapping window) with a specific error message; (c) supports
  teacherId:null → release; (d) pushes a direct Message notification to
  the affected teacher on assign/reassign/release (assign + reassign
  notify the new teacher; release/reassign notify the released one),
  honoring the teacher's examDuty preference server-side (the Settings
  toggle is now a real gate); (e) idempotent same-teacher re-assign.
  listTeachers computes REAL assignedCounts; classLabelOf kills the
  "Grade 9 - A — A" duplication. NEW listDutyRoster(schoolId) + DTOs.
- NEW API GET /api/exams/duties (PRINCIPAL/MANAGEMENT): todayKey + all
  real exams with papers (date/time/room/class/subject/invigilator) +
  teachers with duty counts. POST /api/exams/[id]/invigilator now accepts
  teacherId:null (release). use-exams-extended.ts: useAssignInvigilator
  returns the DTO + accepts null; NEW useDutyRoster hook + DTO types;
  removed unused useTeachers/useAssignInvigilator imports from
  workspace-sections-extended.tsx.
- PHASE C (teacher side): GET /api/teacher/timetable extended with
  examDuties — real ExamScheduleItems dated >= today where the signed-in
  teacher is the invigilator (user-id OR teacher-id OR name match), ≤12,
  with exam/subject/class/room/time. MyTimetable module gained an
  "Examination Duties" section (placed after the TODAY card): date-tile
  rows, emerald today accent, LIVE state chips (Starts X / In progress
  pulse / Concluded) from the client clock, "Tomorrow"/"In N days"
  countdown chips for upcoming, room + time details, stagger animation,
  honest empty state.
- PHASE D (principal UI): NEW tabs/invigilation-tab.tsx in the Exams
  module — exam picker pills (defaults to the exam holding the nearest
  today/future paper), summary tiles (papers / coverage % with spring
  bar / unassigned / teachers on duty), teacher-load chips (initials
  avatar + live per-exam count, click to filter the roster), and the
  date-grouped DUTY TIMETABLE: today + upcoming groups open with a
  shadcn Select per paper (options show name + duty count; "Release
  from duty" when assigned; amber unassigned state), concluded days
  collapsed behind an animated expand header, optimistic row updates +
  revert-on-error, success/error toasts, emerald flash on the changed
  row. Wired as the 'invigilation' section tab in the exams module.
- PERF/UX EXTRAS: ?module=<key> deep-links for teacher + principal
  panels (validated against the module registry/allowlist); exams module
  heavy siblings (ReportsTab/recharts, CreateExamFullScreen, ArchiveView)
  are now dynamic imports with a skeleton — faster first paint.
- API QA (curl): roster payload correct (class labels, real counts,
  pretty statuses); conflict rejection fires with the exact message
  ("Rohan Mehta already has an overlapping invigilation duty at
  09:00–11:00 on 21 Sept 2026"); release → assign verified in the DB;
  Message rows created from Dr. Ananya Iyer to Priya (assigned),
  Arjun (released) — and later Kavita (assigned via the UI test).
  Teacher timetable returns Rohan's 2 duties.
- BROWSER QA (gateway :81; the 4GB box fought hard — see risks):
  TEACHER: panel rendered via ?module=my-timetable + injected session;
  Examination Duties section shows today's English paper with the live
  "Concluded" chip + Mon 21 Sep Hindi with "In 2 days" (screenshot
  download/qa-examduties-teacher-timetable.png). PRINCIPAL: panel
  rendered via ?module=exams; Invigilation tab renders the FULL roster
  (exam pills, 100% coverage tiles, teacher chips, collapsed concluded
  days); reassigning Sep-21 G9 Hindi Priya→Kavita through the Select
  updated the row + counts optimistically, wrote the real DB row
  (invigilatorId = Kavita's user id), and created her notification
  Message (screenshot download/qa-invigilation-assign-kavita.png);
  conflict test (Rohan on an overlapping paper) correctly reverted the
  row and fired the error toast — the specific server message now
  surfaces (api() throws a plain object, not Error — fixed the toast).
- GATES: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean; robots 200;
  event-stream :3003 healthy; teacher API re-verified post-recycle.

Stage Summary:
- USER REQUEST DELIVERED: (1) the teacher Exam Duties module is GONE —
  UI, APIs, lib, prisma models, search mappings, all of it; (2) the
  principal now assigns invigilators per paper inside Examinations →
  Invigilation (a real duty-roster timetable), teachers get a real
  notification (bell message, live via the :3003 stream, preference-
  gated), and teachers see their duties inside My Timetable →
  Examination Duties (today live-state + upcoming countdowns).
- KEY FILES: deleted exam-proctoring/ + proctoring APIs + exam-duty.ts
  + mock/proctoring.ts + 2 prisma models; service-extended.ts
  (invigilator layer rebuilt), NEW /api/exams/duties, timetable route
  (+examDuties), NEW invigilation-tab.tsx, my-timetable.tsx (duties
  section), exams index (tab + lazy splits), teacher/principal panels
  (deep-links).
- DEMO DATA STATE (intentional): Sep-21 G9 Hindi now invigilated by
  Mrs. Kavita Sharma (was Arjun → released → Priya → reassigned during
  QA) — three duty-change Messages exist for Priya/Arjun/Kavita,
  showcasing the notification flow. Rohan's duties: today English
  (concluded) + Mon 21 Sep Hindi.

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. MEMORY (the session's real battle): the box is 4GB/no-swap and the
   dev-server root compile (~2.2-3.1GB RSS) + a browser only fits in
   narrow windows. Root causes found + documented in next.config.ts:
   a POISONED .next (from OOM-killed compiles + a persistentCaching
   experiment) inflated the root compile by ~900MB — deleting .next
   fixed it (root compile 2.24GB, and one generation served / in 34ms
   from a cleanly-completed cache). persistentCaching did NOT survive
   restarts here — don't re-add it. PROVEN WORKING PROTOCOL for future
   browser QA (runbook update): rm -rf .next only when poisoned →
   fresh server → ONE tab, mobile viewport, block images/fonts
   (network route) → open /?module=<key>&fresh=N directly (deep-link
   skips the marketing + login chunks) → inject scholario-auth
   localStorage + erp_session cookie (curl login jar) → reload → the
   panel compiles incrementally and fits. Do NOT pre-warm chunks to
   ~3GB then attach chrome — that reliably OOMs. Keep bursts < ~60s;
   close + recycle between roles. warm-chunks.sh recreated at
   /home/z/.qa/ (+ new warm-bfs.py); /home/z/.qa gets wiped by the
   sandbox sometimes — recreate from this log.
2. The conflict toast's specific message fix (api() throws plain
   objects) is code-verified + the server message is API-proven, but
   the rendered toast with the specific text was not re-screenshotted
   (the Fast-Refresh of the fix killed the last browser window).
3. Principal exams module still runs on the in-memory mock list for
   its Exams/Overview/Reports tabs (long-standing architecture); the
   Invigilation tab is 100% real API. A future phase could switch the
   whole module to the real /api/exams list.
4. Final Examination (Mar 2027) has no papers in the DB yet — the
   Invigilation tab shows its empty state until papers are scheduled.
5. Next-phase candidates: teacher bell deep-link from the duty message
   straight into My Timetable; duty-roster PDF export; overview-tab
   invigilation coverage card; round-8 leftovers (notification prefs
   UI for students, payment auto-refresh).

Task ID: 12
Agent: Z.ai Code (class-teacher role differentiation — 2026-09-20)
Task: "Rohan Mehta is class teacher of 9A but the student directory shows the
same for class teacher and normal teacher (no payment records). The Class
Teacher Hub module must appear ONLY for teachers actually appointed class
teacher; a normal teacher sees the plain panel; an appointed class teacher
gets something extra to manage their class and see overall results
submission. Make it and connect everything."

Work Log:
- RECON: real DB truth — Class.classTeacherId stores the USER id:
  Grade 9 - A → Rohan Mehta (11 students), Grade 10 - A → Arjun Nair
  (8). Kavita (teacher1@demoschool.edu/password123) + Priya teach
  subjects only (22 periods each) — the perfect normal-teacher test.
  The old nav gated the hub on POSITION PERMISSIONS (mock store) —
  appointment never mattered. Principal Classes module is mock-store
  (no real write path to Class.classTeacherId existed).
- BACKEND (4 new surfaces, all server-scoped, never trusting client ids):
  · GET /api/teacher/role (NEW) — the signed-in teacher's REAL
    appointment context { isClassTeacher, classTeacherOf[{id,label,
    room,studentCount}] }. This is the single server truth that gates
    the panel.
  · GET /api/teacher/students (EXTENDED) — fee records for CLASS-TEACHER
    classes ONLY: per student fees{status PAID/PARTIAL/UNPAID/OVERDUE/
    NONE, totalBilled/Paid/outstanding, lastPaymentAt, items[≤8],
    payments[≤5]} + per-class feeSummary{collected/outstanding/fullyPaid/
    pending/overdue}. Subject-only classes get fees:null + no
    feeSummary — a subject teacher can never see a family's money.
  · GET /api/teacher/class-hub (NEW) — the class-teacher control room:
    attendanceToday snapshot, fee totals + defaulters list (overdue
    first, guardian phone), RESULTS SUBMISSION matrix for the 3 most
    recent exams (per CSA subject: entered/class-size, DRAFT vs
    SUBMITTED, avg%), behavior counts (open concerns/monitoring/
    positives 30d).
  · GET /api/classes/class-teachers + PATCH /api/classes/[id]/
    class-teacher (NEW, PRINCIPAL/MANAGEMENT) — the official appointment
    record: real classes × appointed teacher + appointable pool; PATCH
    { teacherUserId | null } validates school scope, is idempotent, and
    pushes a Message notification to the appointed (and released)
    teacher — mirrors the Task-11 invigilator pattern.
- PANEL GATING: nav-registry.tsx — the Class Teacher Hub group is now
  appointment-based (classTeacherOf.length > 0; permission gating
  removed) and carries the NEW 'class-hub' "My Class" item + existing
  'behavior'. teacher-panel.tsx fetches /api/teacher/role once
  (use-teacher-role.ts, hidden-until-confirmed); 'class-hub' added to
  the deep-link allowlist + ModuleRouter (lazy chunk).
- STUDENT DIRECTORY DIFFERENTIATION (teacher/modules/students/): class
  pills now tell the two views apart — "Class Teacher" chip (CT class)
  vs "Teaches <subject> +N" chip (subject class); QuickStats gains a 5th
  "Fee Collection" tile (collected %, ₹ outstanding · N overdue) for CT
  classes only; student cards gain a third "Fees" metric cell (Fees
  clear / ₹N due / Overdue); profile sheet gains a "Fee Payments"
  section (status chip, Billed/Paid/Outstanding tiles, fee lines with
  per-line status, recent payments) — rendered only when the server sent
  fee data; CSV export adds Fee Status + Outstanding columns for CT
  classes; grid header states the boundary ("fee records belong to the
  class teacher").
- NEW CLASS HUB MODULE (teacher/modules/class-hub/, 7 files): emerald
  gradient hero (Class Teacher · Grade 9 - A · 11 students · Room 101 ·
  quick actions Mark Attendance/Enter Marks/Directory/Behavior),
  Attendance Today card (marked ✓ counts / pending → CTA), Class
  Wellbeing card (concerns/monitoring/positives), Fee Collection card
  (spring bar, paid/pending/overdue, defaulters list with phones,
  thin-scroll), Results Submission card (exam pills — defaults to the
  ONGOING exam, per-subject entered-N/N bars + Submitted/Draft/Pending
  chips + avg%, "Open Marks Entry") — the whole-class view the user
  asked for. Honest empty states everywhere; multi-class pills if a
  teacher runs more than one class.
- PRINCIPAL SIDE: classes/index.tsx now renders
  ClassTeacherAppointments (details/class-teacher-appointments.tsx) —
  a 100% real-DB island (Invigilation-tab pattern) at the top of the
  Classes module: each real class + current teacher + shadcn Select to
  appoint/release, optimistic rows with revert-on-error, emerald flash,
  toasts, and copy that explains what the appointment unlocks.
- CONNECTED EVERYTHING: teacher Dashboard — QuickActions prepends a
  "My Class" shortcut for class teachers; the PendingActions hub card
  is now CT-gated (BUG FIX: it promoted the hub to EVERY teacher —
  found live in Kavita's browser snapshot) and now opens the real
  class-hub module.
- API QA (curl, all green): Rohan role → classTeacherOf=[Grade 9 - A];
  students → 9A carries fees (Aarav PARTIAL ₹5,400, Diya PAID) +
  feeSummary {₹2.66L billed / ₹2.36L collected / ₹30.4K outstanding},
  10A (subject class) all null; class-hub → attendance 10P/1A marked,
  defaulters Ananya ₹25K overdue + Aarav ₹5.4K, behavior 1/0/7, results
  PA1 Math 7/11 submitted avg 72%; Kavita → role [] + class-hub
  classes:[] + ZERO fee data anywhere; principal PATCH cycle → Priya
  appointed → Arjun restored → idempotent re-appoint, 4 Message
  notifications created (appointment + release both directions),
  roster back to Rohan 9-A / Arjun 10-A.
- BROWSER QA (gateway :81, mobile 390×844, images/fonts blocked,
  deep-links + injected session — the 4GB box fought hard, see risks):
  ROHAN: sidebar shows "CLASS TEACHER HUB" group with My Class +
  Student Behavior (a11y snapshot); Class Hub rendered end-to-end
  (hero, attendance 10/11, wellbeing 1/0/7, fee collection 89% +
  defaulters, results pills UT2-default + 8 subject rows) — VLM-verified
  screenshot; Student Directory shows "Grade 9 - A · 11 · Class
  Teacher" vs "Grade 10 - A · 8 · Teaches Computer Applications +1"
  pills, ₹30.4K fee tile, per-student "₹5,400 due"/"Fees clear" cells
  (DOM evidence captured mid-render). KAVITA: panel renders with NO
  Class Teacher Hub group (sidebar = OVERVIEW/ACADEMICS/IN-CHARGE/
  COMMUNICATION/INSIGHTS/ACCOUNT only) — this snapshot exposed the
  PendingActions leak (fixed + gates re-run green). Screenshots:
  download/qa12-classhub-rohan.png, qa12-students-rohan.png,
  qa12-kavita-panel.png.
- GATES: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean; robots 200;
  event-stream :3003 200; no chrome zombies; server stable post-QA.

Stage Summary:
- USER REQUEST DELIVERED: (1) the Class Teacher Hub is APPOINTMENT-
  gated — only teachers the principal actually appointed see the group,
  its modules, its dashboard affordances (Kavita sees none of it);
  (2) the Student Directory is now genuinely two views — the class
  teacher of a class sees payment records (fee lines, payments,
  outstanding, class collection stats), a subject teacher sees the
  roster + academics only, with the boundary stated in the UI; (3) the
  appointed class teacher gets "something extra": the My Class hub —
  attendance today, fee collection + defaulters follow-up list, the
  OVERALL RESULTS SUBMISSION matrix across every subject, and class
  wellbeing; (4) everything is connected: the principal appoints from
  the Classes module (official record) → the teacher's sidebar + hub +
  fee views change → the teacher is notified; the appointment IS the
  permission.
- KEY FILES: api/teacher/{role,class-hub}/route.ts + api/teacher/
  students/route.ts (fees) + api/classes/{class-teachers,[id]/
  class-teacher}/route.ts (NEW); teacher-panel/{nav-registry,
  use-teacher-role,teacher-panel,module-router} (gating);
  modules/students/{types,shared,quick-stats,students-grid,
  student-profile-sheet,index} (fee differentiation); modules/class-hub/
  (NEW, 7 files); principal classes {index + details/
  class-teacher-appointments} (NEW); dashboard {quick-actions,
  pending-actions, index} (CT-gated affordances).
- DEMO STATE: 9-A → Rohan (class teacher showcase), 10-A → Arjun —
  restored after the PATCH test cycle; 4 appointment/release Messages
  exist for Priya/Arjun showcasing the notification flow.
  Credentials: rohan.mehta@greenwood.edu.in/teacher123 (CT);
  teacher1@demoschool.edu/password123 (Kavita, normal teacher);
  teacher2@demoschool.edu/password123 (Arjun, CT of 10-A).

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. MEMORY (the defining constraint of this round): the dev server
   OOM-crash-looped repeatedly during browser QA. MECHANICS (now
   understood): (a) an open tab's turbopack HMR client re-requests the
   page after every server restart → root recompile (~2.2-3.1GB) +
   chrome → OOM → keepalive restart → loop; (b) each OOM kill poisons
   .next (root RSS grows 2.2 → 2.6 → 2.9 → 3.1GB across generations);
   (c) .next cache does NOT meaningfully survive restarts (root
   recompiled 18-20s after a cache-keeping restart). WHAT WORKED:
   kill dev tree BY PID → verify zero next processes → rm -rf .next →
   headless curl warm-up (root ~45s + ALL APIs the panel will call) →
   attach ONE mobile tab with images/fonts blocked → deep-link →
   capture the a11y snapshot to a FILE EVERY POLL (the render window is
   ~30-60s before the death) → close the tab the instant evidence
   lands. Screenshots can catch a spinner — the DOM snapshot is the
   source of truth.
2. PRINCIPAL APPOINTMENT CARD — API-verified end-to-end (roster,
   PATCH cycle, idempotency, notifications, optimistic-revert logic
   mirrors the proven Invigilation tab) but NOT browser-rendered: the
   principal panel chunk has never compiled on this box without OOM.
   First browser QA next round should start with the principal
   ?module=classes deep-link on a fresh .next.
3. The teacher panel shell still shows Rohan's MOCK record (T-014
   banners/payroll) for any teacher login — pre-existing demo
   architecture; only the module content follows the real session. A
   future round could make the banners session-aware too.
4. The class-hub results matrix uses the 3 most recent exams with an
   ExamClass link; Unit Test 2 shows honest 0/11 "Pending" rows for 7
   of 8 subjects (only Math has marks, in PA1) — entering a few more
   subject marks via Marks Entry would make the matrix demo-rich.
5. Next-phase candidates: unit-test the fee-status derivation (shared
   with class-hub); "message the defaulters' guardians" action from the
   hub (pre-filled Communication Hub); class-wise PDF export of the
   results submission matrix; round-8 leftovers (notification prefs UI
   for students, payment auto-refresh); UP-BOARD demo tenant for the
   lesson planner (Task 10 leftover).

Task ID: 13
Agent: Z.ai Code (Teacher Student Directory — responsive redesign + zero-collision card architecture — 2026-09-20)
Task: "Redesign + responsive refinement of Teacher Role → Student Directory. Fix text collisions (name ✕ badge, cramped ATTENDANCE/LATEST AVG/FEES labels, fee-status text pushing card heights), bring it to the Principal Directory's design quality, make the grid genuinely content-responsive (320→1920px), zero horizontal overflow, preserve all functionality and the Scholario visual language."

Work Log:
- RECON: studied Teacher students module (7 files, real API) vs Principal
  directory-tab (mock-store, SearchFilterBar, 1/2/3/4-col media grid)
  + AppShell metrics (sidebar 280px expanded / 80px collapsed / overlay
  below lg; content p-4 sm:p-6 lg:p-8). ROOT CAUSE of the screenshot's
  cramped cards: `lg:grid-cols-3` is VIEWPORT-based — at lg/xl with the
  expanded sidebar the content column is only ~680-940px, forcing cards
  to ~210-260px where the 3-cell metric row (label "ATTENDANCE" ≈ 68px
  + p-2 box padding) physically cannot fit → cramped labels, wrapped
  fee values, uneven card heights.
- NEW CARD ARCHITECTURE (teacher/modules/students/student-card.tsx,
  extracted from students-grid for maintainability): fixed three-band
  structure — identity / metric / footer — with structural (not
  cosmetic) collision safety:
  · NAME ✕ BADGE: name = min-w-0 + flex-1 + truncate, badge = shrink-0
    compact StatusBadge (px-2 text-[10px]) with a guaranteed gap —
    geometry-proven in the browser (8px gap, no overlap, with an
    injected 60-char name).
  · METRIC BAND: tinted boxes REPLACED by equal CSS-grid columns with
    hairline divide-x borders — 100% of each cell stays usable (boxes
    wasted 16px/cell on padding, the actual cramp source). Label
    (truncate) / value row (fixed min-h-[26px] so chip-values and
    numeric values render identical heights) / supporting (truncate).
  · FEE VALUE = status chip (bg-emerald/amber/rose) with max-w-full +
    truncating inner label — "Fees clear" / "₹5,400 due" / "Overdue"
    can never escape the column; OVERDUE supporting line carries the
    money detail ("₹25.0K outstanding").
  · FOOTER: guardian truncates against shrink-0 "View profile" +
    ArrowRight that nudges on hover (group-hover).
- CONTENT-AWARE GRID (students-grid.tsx rewrite):
  `grid-cols-[repeat(auto-fill,minmax(min(100%,300px),1fr))]` — the
  CARD (300px minimum usable width), not the viewport, defines the
  breakpoint; adapts to sidebar expanded/collapsed automatically and
  can never overflow horizontally (min(100%,…) collapses to one
  full-width column first). Toolbar refined: search full-width on
  phones / w-60-64 from sm, filter chips 38px touch targets below sm,
  "Showing X of Y" inline with the chips.
- QuickStats breakpoint fix: lg:grid-cols-4/5 → md:grid-cols-3 +
  xl:grid-cols-4/5 (at lg with expanded sidebar only ~680px remain —
  5 tiles of 128px were unreadable; 3-up keeps them readable).
- Functionality untouched: search/filters/CSV/profile sheet/class
  pills all preserved (fee data still renders ONLY for class-teacher
  classes — subject view verified 2-metric cards, 16 cells / 8 cards,
  zero fee leak).
- INFRA REPAIR (sandbox reset had wiped .zscripts + keepalive):
  discovered this session's tool-shell reaps ALL descendant processes
  when a call ends (even setsid+nohup children) — double-fork
  daemonization (( setsid nohup … & ) with PPID=1) is the only
  survivor pattern. Recreated keepalive.mjs (robots-only probe,
  backoff 30→300s, single-instance pidfile, detached respawn —
  respawned children inherit the daemonized PPID=1 keepalive so they
  survive too) and daemonized `bun run dev`. Keepalive proven live:
  it detected the OOM death during the browser QA burst and
  respawned the dev tree automatically.
- BROWSER QA (gateway :81, Rohan class-teacher session, real roster):
  overflow sweep — 320/375/768/1024/1280/1440 ALL
  scrollWidth==innerWidth (zero horizontal overflow). Column counts:
  375→1, 768→2, 1024→2 (the old code forced 3 cramped columns here),
  1280→2 (439px cards), 1440→3. Edge cases: injected 60-char name →
  graceful ellipsis + 8px gap + no badge overlap (geometry-measured);
  injected long family name → clean footer truncation; OVERDUE ₹25K /
  PAID / NONE fee chips all render inside their columns.
  Interactivity: search "diya"→1 card + "Showing 1 of 11"; At Risk
  filter→exactly Saanvi (avg 36%); search+filter combo→correct empty
  state; profile sheet opens with the FEE PAYMENTS section (Billed/
  Paid/Outstanding tiles). VLM audits: 1280px PASS on all 6 items,
  375px + long-name PASS on all 5 items. Screenshots: download/
  qa-1280.png, qa-1280-subject.png, qa-375-cards.png,
  qa-375-longname.png, qa-sheet.png.
- GATES: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean (incl. the
  new keepalive.mjs); robots 200 post-QA; server healthy.

Stage Summary:
- The Teacher Student Directory now matches the Principal Directory's
  quality bar with a strictly better responsive architecture: a
  collision-proof three-band card (name/badge, hairline metric band
  with chip-based fee status, stable footer) + a content-aware
  auto-fill grid that measures the card, not the viewport — zero
  horizontal overflow from 320 to 1440px+, no cramped 3-column
  squeezing beside an expanded sidebar, all existing functionality
  and data boundaries intact. Cross-role visual language preserved
  (GradientAvatar / StatusBadge / tone palette / quiet SaaS cards).
- KEY FILES: teacher/modules/students/{student-card.tsx (NEW),
  students-grid.tsx (rewritten), quick-stats.tsx (breakpoints)};
  keepalive.mjs (recreated at project root).
- The principal's mock-store StudentCard was NOT consolidated into
  the teacher card on purpose: different data sources (Zustand mock
  vs real API DTO) — coupling them would break the principal module;
  visual consistency achieved through shared primitives instead.
- RUNBOOK ADDITION (important for every future round on this box):
  background processes MUST be double-fork daemonized —
  `( setsid nohup CMD < /dev/null > log 2>&1 & )` — plain
  `nohup … &` or even `setsid … &` is reaped when the tool session
  ends. keepalive.mjs + `bun run dev` are both running daemonized
  now; verify with `ps -o ppid= -p <pid>` → PPID 1.

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. MEMORY (unchanged, the defining constraint): the browser QA burst
   OOM-killed the dev server once mid-session (chunk compile spike)
   — keepalive recovered it in <30s and QA resumed. Keep browser
   bursts short, one tab, close+pkill between batches.
2. QUICKSTATS "Fee Collection" tile context ("₹30.4K outstanding · 2
   overdue") truncates at 3-up tile widths — by design (truncate),
   noted by the VLM as tight. A future polish could shorten to
   "₹30.4K out · 2 od" or move to the tile value tooltip.
3. Queued feature work (user-assigned earlier rounds, not started):
   Exam Duties module rebuild (remove old → principal assigns →
   teacher notified → timetable shows duties) and Lessons Planner
   board-syllabus upgrade remain the two named candidates; teacher/
   student attendance UX improvements after those.
4. The principal Classes→ClassTeacherAppointments card is still
   API-verified but not yet browser-rendered (principal panel chunk
   OOM risk) — unchanged from Task 12.

Task ID: 14
Agent: Z.ai Code (MASTER TASK — Teacher/Class-Teacher role architecture, two-stage fee collection, receipts, permissions, data sync & responsive UI — 2026-09-20)
Task: The 53-section master brief (upload/Pasted Content_1789913381475.txt): capability-based Teacher/Class-Teacher architecture, role-aware Student Directory, Class Teacher fee collection with two-stage verification (CT collects → Principal verifies), canonical payment ledger (ONE payment = ONE transaction), DB-backed sequential receipts (SCH-YYYY-NNNN), payment sources, direct principal/office payments visible to CT, notifications, audit trail, server-enforced security, monthly collection views, responsive tables.

Work Log:
- AUDIT: Fee model split across legacy Fee+Payment (flat, no source/verifier) and FeeTransaction (immutable finance ledger with receiptNo, gateway flow). Principal Fees module = mock Zustand store; teacher students API derived fees from Fee.paid. Class Teacher Hub + appointment gating already real (Task 12), Student Directory responsive redesign done (Task 13) — the master brief's NEW core = the fee-collection workflow + receipts + security.
- PRISMA: FeeTransaction extended (additive) with source (CLASS_TEACHER/PRINCIPAL/SCHOOL_OFFICE/ONLINE/BANK_TRANSFER), feeId, collectedById/Name/At, verifiedById/Name/At, rejectedById/Name/At, rejectionReason, referenceNumber + 3 new indexes; status vocabulary gains REJECTED (UNDER_VERIFICATION existed). db:push clean.
- src/lib/fee-workflow.ts (NEW): status/source/method vocabulary, mintReceiptNo (SCH-YYYY-NNNNNN, max+1 inside caller's $transaction, DB-backed), applyPaymentToLedger (Fee.paid += amount + status + paidDate + legacy Payment mirror w/ transactionId link — the ONLY ledger writer, runs ONLY at verification), pushMessage/principalUserIds/audit helpers, assertClassTeacherOfStudent (the §21-22 server gate), assertReferenceUnique (§29-8 duplicate guard), toFeeTxnDto (ONE DTO every surface renders).
- APIs (NEW, all server-scoped, never trusting client ids):
  · GET /api/teacher/fee-collection — per CT class: rosters + fee ledgers (items/office-payments), collection summary (billed/collected/outstanding/overdue/awaitingVerification), month sheet (?month=YYYY-MM), ALL canonical txns. No appointment → classes:[].
  · POST /api/teacher/fee-collection — STAGE 1: creates FeeTransaction UNDER_VERIFICATION (ledger deliberately untouched), validates CT-of-student-class + fee ownership + 0<amount≤outstanding (no overpay) + dup-ref, notifies principals, audit row, honest acknowledgement copy (never "payment successful").
  · GET /api/fees/verification (PRINCIPAL/MGMT) — pending queue + recent 25 resolved + month stats + school roster w/ open fees (for direct payment).
  · POST /api/fees/verification — verify (interactive $transaction: status→SUCCESS + mintReceiptNo + applyPaymentToLedger; collector notified w/ receipt no; idempotency errors) / reject (reason required, ledger never touched, collector notified) / record-direct (§10: created VERIFIED w/ receipt + ledger applied, source PRINCIPAL/SCHOOL_OFFICE, CT of student's class notified "no further collection needed").
  · GET /api/fees/receipts/[txnId] — canonical receipt document: PRINCIPAL/MGMT any; TEACHER only their CT students; STUDENT only own. VERIFIED→official receipt, UNDER_VERIFICATION→provisional acknowledgement (§18), REJECTED→honest notice.
- EXTENDED: /api/teacher/students (payments = canonical txns ∪ pre-workflow office records — each entry carries source/status/receipt/collector/verifier; StudentFeesDto + awaitingVerification), /api/teacher/class-hub (fees + awaitingVerificationCount/Amount).
- TEACHER UI: nav "Fees & Payments" (fee-collection) in Class Teacher Hub group (appointment-gated); module (7 files): honest unavailable state, summary tiles, month sheet w/ picker, filters (search/status/method/source), collection table (desktop) → stacked mobile cards (§33), CollectFeeDialog (fee context due/paid/balance, method/ref/notes, §34 confirmation line, honest "awaiting verification" result), StudentLedgerSheet (fee lines + full payment history + per-line Collect), shared receipt viewer.
- PRINCIPAL UI: VerificationWorkspace (real-DB island, ClassTeacherAppointments pattern) mounted FIRST in Fees→Payments: stat strip, pending queue (table ≥md / cards mobile) w/ View/Verify/Reject, reject dialog (reason required), RecordDirectDialog (§10), recently-resolved feed w/ receipts, optimistic updates + toasts + emerald flash.
- SHARED: components/shared/fee-collection/{txn-meta.tsx (status chips/source stories/method/date formats — ONE vocabulary across roles), receipt-viewer.tsx (school letterhead, student block, fee+balance line, payment trace grid, signatures, print stylesheet for PDF)}.
- CONNECTED: profile-sheet payment history upgraded (source/verification chips, receipt buttons → shared viewer, awaiting-verification banner); class-hub FeesCard + "View collection" CTA + awaiting-verification alert line → fee-collection module.
- API QA (curl, ALL GREEN): Rohan GET → 9A summary ₹2.66L/₹2.36L/₹30.4K + Aarav 4 fee items; Kavita GET → classes:[] (§49). STAGE 1: ₹2,000 from Aarav (Transport) → UNDER_VERIFICATION, ledger untouched, awaiting shown separately. Guards: overpay 400 ("exceeds the outstanding balance of this fee (₹4,500)"), duplicate ref 400, Kavita POST real-9A-student → 403 FORBIDDEN, Rohan POST 10-A student → 403, Rohan calls verify endpoint → 403 (§52). STAGE 2: principal verify → SUCCESS + receipt SCH-2026-000001 + ledger applied (Transport paid 2000, out 4500→2500, PARTIAL); re-verify → 400 idempotent. Direct: ₹10,000 Ananya via School Office → SCH-2026-000002, Rohan sees it ("Paid through School Office") and can't touch it (§50). Reject: ₹500 Aarav → REJECTED w/ reason, exam fee ledger untouched (0/900), Rohan sees reason (§29-5). Rohan's month sheet: Verified ₹12.0K(2). ROLE CHANGE (§51): release 9A → GET classes:[], POST 403, subject classes intact; re-appoint → everything returns. Receipt API: Rohan 200 w/ full doc; Kavita 403. 9 workflow Messages + 5 audit rows verified in DB.
- BROWSER QA (gateway :81, one tab, images/fonts blocked, deep-link + zustand-auth injection): teacher panel rendered ?module=fee-collection END-TO-END — DOM evidence: CLASS TEACHER HUB group w/ My Class/Fees & Payments/Student Behavior; tiles ₹2.66L/₹2.48L 93%/₹0 all-verified/₹18.4K/2 overdue; month September 2026 Verified ₹12.0K(2); filters; 3 txns w/ statuses+sources+receipts. 1280px: sw=innerWidth (zero overflow) + screenshot; 375px mobile: sw=375 (ZERO overflow), stacked transaction cards render (Rejected w/ reason · "Paid through School Office" · receipt numbers) + screenshot. Screenshots: download/qa14-feecollection-{desktop,mobile}.png. The box's OOM-restart loop killed several windows mid-QA (known constraint) — the fee API call through the gateway was observed as a resource entry (200), tiles reflect the API numbers exactly.
- GATES: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean; robots 200 (after keepalive backoff + manual daemonized restart); event-stream :3003 healthy.

Stage Summary:
- MASTER TASK CORE DELIVERED as a real financial system: ONE canonical FeeTransaction per payment with full workflow metadata; CT collects → UNDER_VERIFICATION (ledger untouched, awaiting shown separately) → Principal verifies → SUCCESS + sequential DB receipt + ledger applied + everyone notified; reject returns money-truth to the collector with a reason; direct office payments land in the SAME ledger the CT reads ("Paid through School Office"); subject teachers are denied at the API level (never just hidden UI); role change (release/re-appoint) updates access instantly.
- KEY FILES: prisma/schema.prisma (FeeTransaction +14 fields); src/lib/fee-workflow.ts (NEW); api/teacher/fee-collection/route.ts (NEW GET+POST); api/fees/verification/route.ts (NEW GET+POST); api/fees/receipts/[txnId]/route.ts (NEW); api/teacher/{students,class-hub}/route.ts (extended); teacher/modules/fee-collection/ (NEW, 6 files); shared/fee-collection/{txn-meta,receipt-viewer}.tsx (NEW); principal fees payments/{payments-section + verification-workspace} (NEW island); students/{types,student-profile-sheet} + class-hub/{types,fees-card,index} (upgraded); teacher-panel/{nav-registry,module-router,teacher-panel} (wired).
- DEMO DATA STATE (showcases the workflow): Aarav Transport Fee — ₹2,000 verified by Dr. Ananya Iyer (receipt SCH-2026-000001, balance ₹2,500); Ananya Tuition Q1 — ₹10,000 direct School Office UPI payment (receipt SCH-2026-000002, balance ₹15,000, source story visible to Rohan); Aarav Exam Fee — ₹500 REJECTED ("Reference mismatch…") — ledger untouched. Next receipt will be SCH-2026-000003.
- PERMISSION MATRIX (implemented server-side): Subject Teacher → fee endpoints DENIED; CT → own class ALLOWED / other class DENIED / verify+reject+record-direct DENIED; Principal → everything school-wide; Receipt doc → role-scoped per §17.

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. BROWSER-RENDER VERIFIED for the teacher fee-collection module (desktop 1280 + mobile 375, DOM + screenshots); the principal VerificationWorkspace island is API-verified end-to-end (queue/verify/reject/record-direct + receipts) but NOT yet browser-rendered (principal panel chunk OOM risk on this 4GB box — same as Tasks 12/13 notes). Next round should prioritize a principal ?module=fees deep-link pass on a fresh .next.
2. The CollectFeeDialog submit was verified at the API level (same POST tested 4×) but the click-through-UI path was interrupted by the OOM windows; the dialog's visual render + interaction remains a next-round quick check (open dialog → select fee → submit → acknowledgement state).
3. Teacher students API: legacy Payment rows now tagged "School Office record" — a future tidy-up could backfill them as FeeTransactions for a single history stream.
4. Memory: the OOM restart loop (open tab HMR → root recompile) killed several QA windows; keepalive recovered; dev server manually daemonized again at session end. Keep bursts <60s, one tab, close+pkill between batches.
5. Queued feature work from earlier rounds (not started): Lessons Planner board-syllabus upgrade; teacher/student attendance UX; QuickStats fee-tile copy tightening; notification prefs UI for students.

Task ID: 15
Agent: Z.ai Code (Error-hunt & fix round — QA sweep, api() robustness bug, infra resurrection, fee-workflow UI loop completion — 2026-09-20)
Task: "Find errors and issues then fix all them." — full-project error hunt: server/infra health, browser QA of the Task-14 fee-collection surfaces that had never been click-tested (CollectFeeDialog UI path, principal VerificationWorkspace render), fix everything found, leave gates green.

Work Log:
- INFRA RESURRECTION (issue #1 — the site was DOWN): the dev server had
  been OOM-killed (dmesg: next-server 2.9GB) and the sandbox reset had
  AGAIN wiped keepalive.mjs + .zscripts/ (untracked files vanish on
  platform sync; tracked files with old mtimes can roll back). Recreated
  keepalive.mjs (robots-only probe, 30→300s backoff, pidfile
  single-instance, double-fork detached respawn, 90s boot grace) and
  daemonized it (PPID=1 pattern). It revived the server 8+ times during
  this session's OOM cycles — watchdog proven under fire.
- ⚠️ DISPLAY-PIPELINE ARTIFACT (ghost hunt, save future rounds): this
  tool environment's stdout STRIPS bare ANSI-lookalike sequences —
  "const [mounted" PRINTS as "const ounted" (the "[m" is eaten as an SGR
  terminator). A full "corrupted page.tsx" investigation was a ghost:
  the file was always clean (od -c byte dump proved it; `echo "ab[mcd"`
  → "abcd"). RULE: never trust printed text for byte-exact verification
  — use od -c / base64 / python byte reads.
- REAL BUG FOUND & FIXED — api() raw-HTML error leak
  (src/lib/exams/api-client.ts): when a fetch returns a non-JSON error
  body (the Caddy gateway serves a styled HTML placeholder on 502 —
  which happens on EVERY keepalive OOM-restart window), the ENTIRE HTML
  page became the error message and rendered inside module UIs
  (observed live: a full <!DOCTYPE html>… blob inside the principal
  Payment Verification workspace). Also `'ok' in payload` threw
  TypeError on string payloads. FIX: non-JSON error bodies now collapse
  to "Request failed: <status> — <120-char snippet>", and a 200-response
  HTML body (gateway answering for a dead backend) throws a clean
  "Service temporarily unavailable — please retry" ApiError. Verified
  LIVE in the browser: the workspace now renders the short snippet.
  Gates green after the fix (tsc 0 errors, lint clean).
- TEACHER FEE-COLLECTION UI — FULL LOOP VERIFIED (Task-14 leftover):
  Rohan session → ?module=fee-collection rendered end-to-end (all tiles
  match the API numbers: ₹2.66L billed / ₹2.48L 93% verified / ₹18.4K
  outstanding / 2 overdue; month sheet ₹12.0K(2); 3 txns with receipts
  SCH-2026-000001/000002 and source stories). CollectFeeDialog opened →
  student selector → fee context tiles (₹4.5K due / ₹2.0K paid / ₹2.5K
  balance) → honest §34 confirmation line (updated live with the typed
  amount) → submitted ₹100 (Transport, Cash, ref UTR-88213-QA) → form
  reset + optimistic states updated everywhere (tile "₹100 · 1 collection
  pending", month "Awaiting verification ₹100(1)", tab badge 1, 4th
  txn row "Awaiting verification"). Zero horizontal overflow at 390px.
  Screenshot: download/qa15-feecollection-dialogflow.png.
- PRINCIPAL VERIFICATION API + UI: curl-authenticated GET
  /api/fees/verification returns the ₹100 pending queue (Aarav ·
  Transport — October · UNDER_VERIFICATION · ref UTR-88213-QA ·
  collected by Rohan Mehta; stats 1 pending/₹100, ₹12K verified (2),
  1 rejected). The workspace RENDERS in the browser (header, stat strip,
  Refresh/Record Direct Payment buttons, tabs, mock payments section
  below) with the fixed error handling — but the final click-Verify UI
  step could NOT be completed: 7 disciplined attempts raced the box's
  OOM-restart windows (alive windows shrank to seconds once the preview
  panel's API-compile traffic + browser mount stack ~3.2GB RSS). The
  verify/reject/record-direct POST actions remain API-proven from Task
  14; the UI button wiring (act() → api() → POST → toast → reload) is
  the same path as the load that now works. THE ₹100 IS STILL PENDING —
  a ready-made demo artifact for the next round's first verify click
  (will mint receipt SCH-2026-000003).
- QA-METHODOLOGY LESSONS (runbook additions):
  · NEVER block "**/*hmr*" — it kills the turbopack HMR client SCRIPT
    (a synchronous bootstrap script) → totally blank page. Block only
    "**/_next/webpack-hmr*" (the websocket) to stop the auto-reload
    loop while keeping the app bootable.
  · Blocking "**/api/app-version*" stops VersionGuard's stale-tab
    hard-reload (every server restart bumps the version → every open
    tab reloads → recompile → OOM loop fuel).
  · CHUNK PRE-COMPILATION VIA CURL (the OOM-breaker): the compiled
    chunk graph is discoverable headlessly — fetch the root HTML, walk
    the manifests (panel chunk → TURBOPACK_CHUNK_LISTS sub-chunk URLs →
    module chunk manifests), curl every URL → turbopack compiles them
    WITHOUT a browser attached. Proven for teacher + principal panel
    chains (all 200s, seconds). After a restart the in-memory cache is
    gone but the SST cache (.next/dev/cache, ~634MB) re-serves fast.
  · DO NOT rm -rf .next/dev/cache (or .next/cache) — that persistent
    SST cache is what keeps post-restart compiles cheap. (Accidentally
    deleted this round; it rebuilt over ~15 min of generations.)
  · The user's PREVIEW PANEL polls /, /api/app-version, /api/auth/me,
    /api/notifications-feed, /api/schools/public, /api/fees/defaulters
    continuously — every server revival recompiles these routes first;
    they are the baseline memory cost of any generation.
  · Stable QA sequence that worked: server dead → close browser →
    revival + root warm via curl → chunk-graph pre-compile via curl →
    API warm via curl (login with {"email":…} to get erp_session
    cookie) → attach ONE browser with state load → clicks in <30s →
    close the instant evidence lands.
- GATES: bunx tsc --noEmit 0 errors; bun run lint clean (both after the
  api-client fix). robots 200 post-recovery; keepalive freshly restarted
  (backoff reset — instant revival instead of 300s waits).

Stage Summary:
- FOUND & FIXED: (1) the site was dead with no watchdog — keepalive
  recreated and battle-tested; (2) the api() client leaked entire HTML
  error pages into module UIs during every gateway 502 window — now
  sanitised (short snippets + clean unavailable message), verified live;
  gates green. (3) QA-methodology bugs in my own tooling (over-broad
  hmr blocking, app-version reload loop, cache deletion) identified and
  codified into the runbook.
- COMPLETED VERIFICATIONS: teacher fee-collection module + CollectFeeDialog
  FULL UI loop (₹100 collected, honest acknowledgement everywhere);
  principal verification queue API + workspace render + error-handling;
  the ₹100 txn awaits verification as demo data.
- KEY FILES: src/lib/exams/api-client.ts (hardened); keepalive.mjs
  (recreated); download/qa15-feecollection-dialogflow.png (evidence).
- HONEST GAP: the principal's click-Verify UI step is API-proven but
  not browser-click-proven (box's OOM windows); next round's first
  browser QA should finish it (pending ₹100 → Verify → receipt
  SCH-2026-000003 → receipt viewer).

## Unresolved issues / risks, next-phase priorities

1. THE 4GB OOM CYCLE (worsened): alive windows degraded to seconds
   during heavy QA. The compile-OOM loop is fueled by (a) the preview
   panel's continuous polling, (b) every open tab's API suite, (c) any
   browser attach. The curl pre-compile technique mitigates but cannot
   eliminate it. If a future round needs heavy browser QA, consider:
   reducing the root page's dynamic-import graph, or asking the user to
   close the preview panel during QA bursts.
2. PRINCIPAL VERIFY-CLICK (first priority next round): the ₹100 is
   pending; one clean browser window (post-stability) completes the
   loop + receipt viewer screenshot. Sequence is in the runbook above.
3. Teacher panel shell still shows Rohan's MOCK record for any teacher
   (banners/payroll/salary confirmation) — pre-existing demo
   architecture, unchanged.
4. The workspace's stat strip shows mock defaults while the queue fetch
   errors — a polish idea: derive the strip from the last successful
   payload instead of mock constants.
5. Queued feature work (user-assigned earlier rounds, not started):
   Exam Duties module rebuild, Lessons Planner board-syllabus upgrade,
   teacher/student attendance UX, QuickStats fee-tile copy tightening.
